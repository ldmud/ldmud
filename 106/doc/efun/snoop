SYNOPSIS
	object snoop(object snooper)
	object snoop(object snooper, object snoopee)

DESCRIPTION
	Starts a snoop from 'snooper' on 'snoopee', or if 'snoopee' is not
	given, terminates any snoop from 'snooper'.

	Return 1 on success, -1 if a snooping loop would be caused, 0 for
        any other failure.

	The snoop is checked with the master object for validity.
	It will also fail if the 'snoopee' is being snooped already or
	if a snoop would result in a recursive snoop action.
