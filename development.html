<h2>Roadmap</h2>

<h3>Work currently in progress:</h3>
<dl>
  <dt><a href="https://mantis.ldmud.eu/mantis/">General bugfixing and small features</a></dt>
  <dd>
    After having done a new major release, we focus on bugfixes, small improvements
    and minor features. Also the new features of LDMud 3.5.0 will surely need some
    polishing.
  </dd>

  <dt><a href="https://mantis.ldmud.eu/mantis/view.php?id=432">Unicode support</a></dt>
  <dd>
    Make LPC strings accept unicode characters by converting all external
    input into an internal unicode encoding (eg. UTF-8) and make all
    string routines unicode-aware.
  </dd>
