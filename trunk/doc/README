DESCRIPTION
	These man pages are organised in chapters, that are stored in
	separate directories. A reference to foo(X) means the function
	foo as descibed in chapter X, where X is one of:

	A for applied/    member functions (lfuns) that the driver applies
                          to objects
	C for concepts/   general concepts of LPMUD and LPC
	D for driver/     some info about internal operation of the driver
	E for efun/       the ``system calls'' of LPC
              efun.de/    german translations of the efun/ manpages.
        H for hook/       the driver hooks
	LPC for LPC/      about parts of the LPC language
	M for master/     lfuns that are applied to the master object only
        O for obsolete/   docs for features removed from the driver
        OTHER for other/  other useful MUD-related documents

 	This collection does not contain anything about mudlib specific
	object classes or lfuns, and also not about any simulated
	efuns (from the simul_efun object), because all these are not
	specific for the driver but for the particular installation.

	Man-pages for the functions in the installation's simul_efun
	object could go e.g. into the chapter SE (directory sefun/),
	man pages for the standard objects (base classes) of the mudlib
	would e.g. fit into chapter S (directory std/).


	The man pages generally adhere to the following format, which
	was inspired by the Unix man pages.

	<manpage> ::= <section>+

	There are one or more sections in a man page.

	<section> ::= <section-name><newline><section-text><newline>

	The section names are always at the beginning of a line, and
	in all capital letters (debatable uglyness).

	<section-name> ::=   'NAME' | 'CONCEPT' | 'SYNOPSIS'
			   | 'LAST UPDATED'
			   | 'SYNTAX' | 'DESCRIPTION' | 'AUTHOR' | 'BUGS'
			   | 'CAVEATS' | 'WARNING' | 'NOTE' | 'NOTES'
			   | 'EXAMPLE' | 'EXAMPLES' | 'HISTORY'
			   | 'SEE ALSO'

	If a NAME or CONCEPT section occurs, it should give the name of
	the man page.
	If a SYNOPSIS section occurs, the name of the man page can be
	derived from the function name, that appears in the line after
	SYNOPSIS, which looks as follows:

	<returntype><space>['*']<function-name>'('<parameter-prototypes>

	SEE ALSO is followed by one or more lines that contain
	crossreferences of the form

	<crossreferences> ::=
		<crossref>[','<white-space><crossref>]*<white-space><EOF>
	<crossref> ::= <man-page-name>'('<chapter-abbrev>')'

	The names of the referenced man pages are followed in brackets
	by an abbreveiation for the chaper (i.e. directory) the man
	page is in. The abbrevs are

	If you want to process these man pages by some converter
	program, you can use these to map the chapter names to file
	names or whatever. There should be some sample awk scripts or
	the like near this README file.

HISTORY
        Most of the documentation is based on the 'driver-docs' collected
        by Stefan 'Pepel' Petri up to Amylaar LPMud 3.2.1@141 and 3.2@316.
        It was collectect from the original 2.4.5 docs, from the installed
        docs of Nightfall, TubMud and MorgenGrauen.

	Collection, correction and completion was done by Pepel@Nightfall,
	with assistance and support by the LPC wizards of Nightfall,
	TubMud, MorgenGrauen and TAPPMud, namely Hyp, Macbeth,
	Mateese, and Marcus. Also to mention are Bumblebee, Boing,
	Deepthought, Demos, Hate, Jof, Symmetry@TMI2.

        The documentation was integrated into the driver distribution
        in LDMud 3.2.6.
