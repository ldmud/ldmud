SYNOPSIS
        object set_modify_command(object)
        object set_modify_command(string)
        object set_modify_command(int)

DESCRIPTION
        All commands for the current object (that must obviously be
        interactive) will be passed to ob->modify_command() before
        actually being executed. The argument can be passed an object
        or an object_name.

        When set_modify_command() was called, the parser won't expand
        the standard abbreviations n,e,s,w,nw,sw,ne,se for that user
        anymore, nor use any hook set for this.

        0 as argument will stop the command modification and reinstall
        the standard abbreviations.
        -1 as argument will just return the object previously set.

        The return value is the object that was previously set with
        set_modify_command(), if any.

        This mechanism is intended to expand aliases on quicktypers
        or the like. The name of the lfun called can be changed
        from modify_command() to something else using the
        H_MODIFY_COMMAND_FNAME hook.

HISTORY
        Up to 3.2.1@108 the lfun called was hardcoded as
        'modify_command'. The hook H_MODIFY_COMMAND_FNAME introduced
        in 3.2.1@109 allows to change the name.
