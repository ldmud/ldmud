NAME
        master for LDMud 3.3

DESCRIPTION
        This directory contains descriptions for the functions that
        LDMud expects to find in the master object (similar to lfuns,
        but for the master object only). The name of the master object
        is hardcoded in the parser, but can also be specified on
        the commandline (usually to "secure/master").

        The master is the gateway between the interpreter and the
        mudlib to perform actions with mudlib specific effects. Calls
        to the master by the interpreter have an automatic catch() in
        effect. Functions to be called by the driver can be public
        or static, but not private.

        Note that the master is loaded first of all objects. Thus you
        shouldn't inherit an other object, nor is the compiler able to
        search include files (read: they must be specified with full
        path).

        Amylaar says: actually, you can inherit, but the file will be
        loaded then before the master, which isn't good for most
        files.

        A short survey of the things that happen at system startup
        time:

        The Initialisation functions are called after (re)loading the
        master to establish the most basic operation parameters.

        The initialisation of the mud on startup follows this schedule:
          - The interpreter evaluates the commandline options and
            initializes itself.
          - The master is loaded, but since the driverhooks are not set yet,
            no standard initialisation lfun is called.
          - get_master_uid() is called. If the result is valid, it becomes the
            masters uid.
          - inaugurate_master() is called.
          - flag() is called for each given '-f' commandline option.
          - get_simul_efun() is called.
          - the WIZLIST is read in.
          - epilog() is called. If it returns an array of strings,
            they are given one at a time as argument to preload().
            Traditionally, these strings are the filenames of the objects to
            pre-load, which preload() then does.
          - The interpreter sets up the IP communication and enters
            the backend loop.

        If the master is reloaded during system operation, this
        actions are taken:
          - The master is loaded, and its initialisation lfun is
            called according to the settings of the driverhooks (if set).
          - Any auto-include string and all driverhooks are cleared.
          - get_master_uid() is called. If the result is valid, it becomes the
            masters uid and euid.
          - inaugurate_master() is called.

        If the master was destructed, but couldn't be reloaded, the old
        master object could be reactivated. In that case:
          - reactivate_destructed_master() is called.
          - inaugurate_master() is called.


        Security hint: most of this functions are not useful to be
        called directly from other objects and can be made private or
        static. Unlike create(), these functions that are applied to
        the master object are found by the interpreter even if not
        publicly accessible.
