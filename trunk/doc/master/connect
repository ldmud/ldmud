SYNOPSIS
        object connect(void)

DESCRIPTION
        Return a login object that the requested connection should be
        bound to. 

        Note that the connection is at this time bound to the master object,
        and will be re-bound to the returned object.

        The lfun logon() will be applied to the login object after
        binding the connection to it. That lfun has to return != 0 to
        indicate success.

        If connect() initiates a secure connection without setting a callback,
        and the connection is still handshaking at the time connect() returns,
        the driver will delay the call to logon() until the handshake either
        succeeds or fails.

HISTORY
        LDMud 3.2.13/3.3.713 streamlined the handling of secure connections
        during logon.
