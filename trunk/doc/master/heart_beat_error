SYNOPSIS
        mixed heart_beat_error(object culprit, string err, string prg,
                               string curobj, int line, int caught)

DESCRIPTION
        This function is called when a runtime error occurs while
        executing the heart_beat() function of the object culprit. prg
        is program where the actual error happened, in object curobj
        at the given line.

        At time of call, the heart_beat has been turned off.
        Return anything != 0 to restart the heart_beat in culprit.

        If culprit is a user, it should at least get the message ``You
        have no heartbeat''. A more advanced handling would destruct
        the offending object curobj and and allow the heartbeat to
        restart.

        If the error is caught on a higher level, <caught> is non-zero;
        otherwise it is 0.

        Note that prg denotes the program actually executed (which
        might be an inherited one) whereas curobj is just the
        offending object.

HISTORY
        LDMud 3.2.12/3.3.705 added the <caught> argument.
