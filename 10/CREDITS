The program was written originally by

Lars Pensj|, April 1989 (lars@cd.chalmers.se).


Other credits:

The regexp package was made by Henry Spencer.

The ed package was not done by me. See the file ed.c for information.

Bit manipulations was implemented by pell@lysator.liu.se who also found
several bugs that had eluded me for months.

Valuable help and hints from: Mark Nagel, James Seidman, Moonchilde and more.

Roland Dunkerley III fixed for-loops, do-while and the operators ++ and --.

Sean T Barrett made smalloc.c.

Lennart Augustsson convinced me to implement a compiler for a virtual
stack machine. He also implemented the built-in preprocessor.

John S. Price found and fixed many bugs.

The shadow idea was "forwarded" to me by John S. Price from Team Cthulhu
(Bill Burdick, Roy Riggs, Mitch Adler).

Michael Malone, Michael O'Reilly, Klaus Rennecke, J|rn Rennecke and
Germano Caronni found and fixed a large amount of bugs.

Petri Wessman fixed changes for SCO unix and AIX.

The non-corrupting indentation code for ed was written by Felix A. Croes,
			aka Dworkin, email: croes@swi.psy.uva.nl .

Mud-sprintf() is from  Lynscar (Sean A Reith) , email: gusar@uniwa.oz.au

The alist based mapping implementation was supplied by Dworkin.

The idea for query_actions and an implementation that has been partially used
  is from Peter Eriksson (aka lpd) pen@lysator.liu.se
The port to Amiga was done by Mateese ( Lars Duening )
The udp connectivity is from the CD driver, and was fitted in by deepthought.
Demos, Freaky, Hurl, Hyp, Mateese, Pepel and Jof did a lot of alpha
  testing.
Reimer Behrends located a lot of bugs. He also supplied a portable macro to
  test numbers for having but a single bit set, a mergesort based
  sort_array() and variadic function support.

get_object_actions() was supplied by herp.

Marcus Meissner found and fixed many bugs.
