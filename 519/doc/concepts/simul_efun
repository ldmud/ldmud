CONCEPT
        simul_efun

DESCRIPTION
        The simul_efun object is automagically sort-of inherited by
        every object. That functions that are defined in it can be
        accessed just like efuns or inherited functions by every
        object (except the master object). To get access to efuns that
        are overloaded by the simul_efun object, you can use the
        efun::function() to bypass the simul_efun (unless the
        simul_efun object has defined the function as ``nomask'').
