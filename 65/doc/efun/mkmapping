SYNOPSIS
	mapping mkmapping(mixed *arr1, mixed *arr2,...)

DESCRIPTION
	Return a mapping with indices from 'arr1' and values from
	'arr2'... . arr1[0] will index arr2...[0], arr1[1] will index
	arr2...[1], etc. If the arrays are of unequal size, the mapping
	will only contain as much elements as are in the smallest
	array.

	Normally, mappings are extended by simply inserting new elements.
	This function is useful if you can estimate the needed size of
	the mapping in advance, to reduce the malloc overhead. Any
	unused allocated space will be freed after the current function
	returns. 

EXAMPLE
	mkmapping( ({ 1, 2 }), ({ 10, 11 }), ({ 20, 21, 22}))
	  returns ([ 1:10;20, 2:11;21 ])

SEE ALSO
	mappings(LPC), mappingp(E), m_indices(E), m_values(E),
	m_delete(E), sizeof(E), widthof(E), unmkmapping(E).
