SYNOPSIS
	void set_this_player(object ob)

DESCRIPTION
	Change the current command giver to <ob>. <ob> may be 0 if
        you want to 'deactivate' the current command giver.

	This efun is not privileged, therefore it should be redefined
	by a nomask simul_efun which then either completely disables
	the efun or at least performs some security checks.
	It is easy to undermine a mudlibs security using this efun.

	The efun is available only in 3.2.1, a possible simulation for
	3.2 could be:

	  void set_this_player(object ob) 
          {
	    /* Insert your privilege checks here */
	    if (living(ob))
	      funcall(bind_lambda(#'enable_commands, ob));
	  }

	(suggested by Mark Lewis (Nostradamus@Zebedee))

HISTORY
	Introduced in 3.2.1.
        LDMud 3.2.6 added the value 0 as acceptable parameter.
