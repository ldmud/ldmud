DEPRECATED
SYNOPSIS
        void add_verb(string str)

DESCRIPTION
        This function is connected to the add_action() function. It
        will set up the command str to trigger a call to the function
        set up by the previous call to add_action().
        
        This function is now obsolete as the verb can be given directly
        with add_action(). add_verb() remains for compatibility.
