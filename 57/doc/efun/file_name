SYNOPSIS
	string file_name()
	string file_name(object ob)

DESCRIPTION
	Get the file name of an object or if no argument is given of
	the current object. 

	For blueprints, the returned name is the filename from which
	the object was compiled (without a trailing '.c'), for cloned
	objects it is the name of the blueprint, extended by '#'
	followed by a unique non-negative number.

	Note that the newly introduced virtual objects and the efun
	rename_object() may give an object a name which does not
	conform the rules given above.
	
	The returned name always begins with '/' (absolute path),
	except when the parser runs in COMPAT (-o) mode.

EXAMPLES
		find_object(file_name(ob)) == ob
	
	This is guaranteed to be true for all objects ob that are not
	destructed.
	
		sizeof(explode(file_name(ob), "#")) == 1
	
	This is true if ob is a blue print (note that this is not
	necessarily true anymore since the introduction of
	rename_object()).
