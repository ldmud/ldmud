SYNOPSIS
	object clone_object(string name)

DESCRIPTION
	Clone a new object from definition name, and give it a new unique
	name. Return the new object.
	
	The original, called blue print, used for cloning, should not be
	used in the system, only be used for cloning. The cloned objects
	contain only the data but the blue print also the function code.
	The blue print is the one without a unique number at the end of
	the object's file_name(). The clone_object() function never
	returns a blue print.
	
	Note that the pathname must be complete, which means there are no
	relative paths allowed.

EXAMPLE
	object torch;
	torch = clone_object("/obj/torch");
