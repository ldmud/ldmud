CONCEPT
        files

DESCRIPTION
        As a wizard, you are working with files. Each file represents
        the bulding plan for one or more objects (except text or doc files
        of course).

        The mudlib has a root, and when working with filenames, you
        can always specify a full pathname from the root by starting
        with a '/' (slash) at the beginning of the file name.

        (oops, truncated - why when where did it happen?)

SEE ALSO
        objects(C), create(A), reset(A)
