gcc 3.0
  Optimization option -funroll-all-loops seems to create buggy code.

gcc 2.91.66 19990314/Linux (egcs-1.1.2) on Linux/x86:
  Computing MIN_LONG % -1 causes a floating point exception.

xlc on AIX 3.4:
  Optimization level -O4 -qipa crashes in the code generation if a void
  returning function is casted to a value returning one.

egcs 2.91.66 on Linux 2.2.15 on Sun SparcStation4:
  The optimizer neglects to reload CPU registers after a setjmp() in
  complex functions (namely eval_instruction() in interpret.c). The
  workaround is to put the setjmp()-recover branch into a separate function
  and making sure that it can't be inlined (e.g. by calling it indirectly).

gcc 2.8.1 on Solaris 5.7; egcs 2.91.16 on SunOS 4.1.3_U1, and probably
others:
  Compiling with optimization causes the compiler (not the assembler!) to
  fall into catatonia for the configuration test for a float/branch
  incompatibility. Workaround is to make sure that configure compiles this
  test without optimization.

gcc 2.9-beos-980929 on BeOS/x86:
  Compiling without optimization causes the compiler to crash on simulate.c

gcc 2.7.2.1-i486-linux on Linux 2.0.33:
  Optimizing compiles may pessimize the expression
    (svalue.type == x && svalue.x.closure_type == y)
  to 'comparison is always zero' if both fields share the same longword
  in memory (closure.c is one victim).
  Makeshift solution: Assigning one of the fields to a local variable
  causes the expression to produce the correct result.

gcc 1.36 on Next / NextStep 2.1 with flags '-g' / '-g -fomit_frame_pointer' :
  The calculated offset to a6 for parameter access in free_svalue() is wrong.
  Symptom: mud crashes early.
  Makeshift solution: use '-O -fomit-frame-pointer'

gcc 2.2.2 , when told to optimize interpret.c , usually dies with a segv
  or currupted internal data structures in cc1.

gcc 2.3.3 , when told to optimize lex.c , will garble the code for #include.
  Symptom: load_object will fail when #include is used, saying it can't
  #include the file.

gcc 2.x on 680x0 hardware: the large interpret.c switch table is built with
  unsigned short words, but is processed like signed short words.
  The special thing about 680x0 is that the switch in interpret.c is
  shorter than 64 KB.
  Symptoms: when LPC instructions are to be executed the code to which
  lies beyond the first 32 KB of the switch(), there is weird behaviour,
  a C-level illegal intruction or a crash with undetermined, although most
  times quite short, latency.
  Makeshift solution: fix the assembler code in interpret.s to handle
  unsigned short offsets.

NeXTStep 3.2 has a broken memcmp(), that will give different return values
  depending on alignment.
  The library that contained this broken memcmp() looks like this:
    -r-xr-xr-x  1 root     1012100 Sep  1  1993 libsys_s.B.shlib*
  quickfix: #define memcmp(a,b,l) (*(int*)(a) - *(int*)(b)) in closure.c and
  prolang.y, or a file included by these.

ULTRIX dec1 4.3 0 RISC needs <sys/types.h> to be included before <sys/stat.h>
