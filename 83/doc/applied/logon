SYNOPSIS
	int logon(void)

DESCRIPTION
	When the parser accepts a new connection, it first calls
	connect() in the master object and then applies logon() to
	the object that is returned by the master. That will usually be
	a special login object, that is expected to clone and get going
	a user shell or user object.
	Should return 0 on failure, everything else means success.

SEE ALSO
	connect(M), exec(E)
