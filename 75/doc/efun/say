SYNOPSIS
	void say(string str)
	void say(string str, object exclude)
	void say(string str, object *excludes)
	void say(mixed *arr)
	void say(mixed *arr, object exclude)
	void say(mixed *arr, object *excludes)

DESCRIPTION
	There are two major modes of calling:
	
	If the first argument is a string and no second argument is
	given, str will be send to all livings in the current room
	except to the initiating object which called the say() function.
	If the second argument is an object the str also won't be sent
	to this on. If the second argument is an array of objects the
	message won't be sent to the objects in the array. If the
	receiving object(s) is not interactive, the lfun catch_tell()
	will be applied to the object, with str as argument.
	
	If the first argument is an array, the applied lfun catch_msg() 
	of all living objects (except the initiating one which invoked
	the say() function) will be called. This array will be given as
	first argument and the one who invoked say() as second argument to
	lfun catch_msg(). If the second argument to say() is an object
	or an array of objects then those objects will also be
	excluded from the call of catch_msg().
	
	The 'initiating object' determines according to these rules:
	  - if the say() is called from within a living object, this
	    becomes the initiator
	  - if the say() is called from within a dead object as result
	    of a user action (i.e. this_player() is valid), this_player()
	    becomes the initiator.
	  - Else the object calling the say() becomes the initiator.

EXAMPLES
	say("Hi!\n");
	say("Hi!\n", this_player());
	Both calls are equal when called by a not living object.
	
	Object 1 (living):
	   void catch_tell(string str) {
	      write("Received: "+str+"\n");
	   }
	Object 2 (not living):
	   void func() {
	      ...
	      say("HiHo!\n");
	      ...
	   }
	
	This examples shows how say() together with catch_tell()
	works. The 2nd object must not be living so the write() will
	go to the current user.
	
	
	Object 1 (living):
	   void catch_msg(mixed *arr, object who) {
	      int i;
	      if(!arr) return;
	      for(i=0;i<sizeof(arr);i++)
		 tell_object(who, (stringp(arr[i]) ? arr[i] : "-/-")+"\n");
	   }
	Object 2 (not living):
	   void func() {
	      ...
	      say( ({ "Hello", "there!" }) );
	      ...
	   }
	
	This is a bit complex example to demonstrate how say() and
	catch_msg() works. Here we also use a non living object to
	send the message so the who in catch_msg() will be the current
	user.
