CONCEPT
	driver modes / native driver mode

DESCRIPTION
	During the evolution of LPMud there has been a hiatus as the
	old driver became too restricting for the demands of modern
	muds: it did a lot of things the mudlib could do better or
	completely different. Removing these things from the driver
	weren't a problem, but to keep compatible with the existing
	mudlibs (namely the well-known 2.4.5 lib), it was possible to
	undo these changes. First by setting a runtime option, then
	by compiling the driver either in 'compat' or in 'native'
	mode.
	Starting with 3.2.1, the distinction between compat and native
	mode is more and more transferred into the mudlib, to finally
	have a modeless driver.

	For 3.2 and 3.2.1, the mode of the driver is determined by
	three preprocessor symbols to be defined/undefined in
	config.h:

	  COMPAT_MODE: when defined, the compat mode specifics are activated.
	  NATIVE_MODE: when defined, the native mode specifics are activated.
	  EUIDS      : when defined, the euid handling is activated
	               (3.2.1 only)

	Almost any combination is possible. While defining COMPAT_MODE
	and undefining NATIVE_MODE configures the driver to run in
	true compat mode, it is possible to e.g. undefine both _MODEs
	and just define EUIDS to get an unspecific driver with euid
	handling, or to have both NATIVE_ and COMPAT_MODE defined (not
	that this would make much sense).
	Note that NATIVE_MODE is only possible together with EUIDS.

	Following is the description of the changes (de) activated by
	these defines. A shorthand notation is used: 'compat' means
	'if COMPAT_MODE is defined' and '!compat' means 'if
	COMPAT_MODE is not defined' (same for 'native' and 'euids').


	Predefined Preprocessor Symbols
	  If compat, the symbols COMPAT_FLAG and __COMPAT_MODE__ are
          defined for all LPC programs.
          If native, the symbol __NATIVE_MODE__ is defined for all
          LPC programs.
          If euids, the symbol __EUIDS__ is defined for all
          LPC programs.


	Preloading Of Objects
	  The driver has the possibility to preload objects before the
	  game is actually opened to the world. This is done by
	  calling master->epilog(), which has to return 0 or an array.
	  If its an array, its elements (as long as they are strings)
	  are given one by one as argument to master->preload() which
	  may now preload the objects (or do anything else).
	  Up to 3.2, compat mode used a different scheme: the file
	  INIT_FILE (defined in config.h) was read and each line
	  interpreted as filename of an object to preload. After this
	  was done, master->epilog() was called. This was dumped in
	  3.2.1 as it can be simulated by the master.


	Initialisation Of Objects
	  Since 3.2.1, it is task of the mudlib to call the
	  initialisation lfuns in newly created objects, so the
	  following table applies only up to 3.2:

	          mode        : init call : reset call
           --------------------------------------------
	    !compat & !native :  create() :  reset(1)
	    !compat &  native :  create() :  reset()
	     compat & !native :  reset(0) :  reset(1)
	     compat &  native :  reset(0) :  reset(1)
	  
	  If INITIALIZATION_BY___INIT was defined, the lfun __INIT()
	  is called first on creation to initialize the objects
	  variables.


	Movement Of Objects
	  Since 3.2.1, the efun move_object() is implemented in the
	  mudlib. 
	  Before, move_object() could applied only to this_object() as
	  the object to move if in native mode, and called the lfun
	  exit() in the old environment if in compat mode. As a side
	  effect, the lfun exit() may not be target of add_action()s
	  in compat mode.

	  In !native mode, objects may be moved using the transfer()
	  efun. It does make assumptions about the design of the
	  mudlib, though, as it calls the lfuns query_weight(),
	  can_put_and_get(), get(), prevent_insert() and add_weight().


	Efuns In General
	  command()
	    In native mode, this may just take the command string,
	    which is always applied to this_object(). In !native mode,
	    an object to apply the command to may be optionally
	    specified.

	  creator(), transfer()
	    These are existing only in !native mode (creator() is
	    identical with getuid()).

	  getuid()
	    Exists only in !compat mode (getuid() is identical with
	    creator()).

	  export_uid(), geteuid(), seteuid()
	    These exist only in euids mode.

	  file_name(),function_exists() 
	    In !compat mode, the returned filenames start with a
	    leading '/', in compat mode they don't.

	  parse_command()
	    This command exists in two versions: the old is used with
	    compat, the new with !compat. However,
	    SUPPLY_PARSE_COMMAND must be defined in config.h in both
	    cases (this efun is not very useful at all).

	  process_string()
	    In native & euids mode, if this_object() doesn't exist, it
	    defaults to this_player() and gets the backbone uid
	    (returned by master->get_bb_uid()) as euid.

	  snoop()
	    Besides that the call is verified with a call to
	    master->verify_snoop(), up to 3.2 the snooper has to have
	    a non-zero euid.

	Userids and Effective Userids
	  This is probably the most important difference between the
	  modes.

	  LPMud always had userids (uids) attributing the objects,
	  though they were called 'creator names' in compat mode.
	  Internally, the compat mode uses the 'creator names' as
	  (e)uid.

	  With the introduction of native mode, additionally
	  'effective userids' (euids) were introduced to improve
	  security handling (which was only a partial success). 
	  The hardcoded handling of euids and uids was quite complex
	  and too mudlib-insensitive, so most of it got moved from the
	  driver into the mudlib with 3.2.1.

	  In euids mode, the euids are managed at all, thus every
	  following mention of 'euid' implies the activation of euid
	  mode. Remember that native mode implies euids mode as well.

	  In native mode, only objects with a non-zero euid may load
	  or create new objects.

	  --- 3.2.1 ---

	    Userids of the Master
	      The masters (e)uid is determined by a call to
	      master->get_master_uid().
	      In native mode, the result has to be a 0 or a string,
	        else the driver won't start up at all. If the result is
	        valid it is set as the masters uid (and also euid if in
	        native && euids mode).
	      In !native mode, the result may be any value: 0 or a
	        string are treated as the uid to set, a non-zero integer
	        leads to the use of the uid set in the default 'global'
	        wizlist entry, and any other value defaults to 0. 
	        In !native && euids mode, the euid is either set to the
	        returned string (if any), or to 0.
	      The masters uid is determined only on startup this way,
	      at runtime the uids of a reloaded master determined as
	      for every object by a call to the appropriate driver
	      hooks.

	    Userids of New Objects
	      To determine the (e)uids for a new object (loaded or
	      inherited, or cloned), the appropriate driver hook is
	      evaluated (H_LOAD_UIDS, H_CLONE_UIDS) and the result set
	      as (e)uid. In euids mode the result may be a single
	      value, then the euid is set to 0, or an array ({ uid,
	      euid }). 
	      In native mode, both uid and must be 0 or a string, any
	        other value causes the load/clone to fail.
	      In !native mode, the uid (however returned) may also be
	        a non-zero integer to use the uid of the global
	        wizlist entry as uid. In euids mode, the euid is then
	        set to either 0 or the second entry of the returned
	        array if it's a string.

	  --- 3.2 ---

	    LPMud <= 3.2 in !compat mode has the algorithm deciding _which_
	    (e)uid to set hardcoded into the driver. For this it
	    features two builtin uids: the root uid (queried by a call
	    to master->get_root_uid()) and the backbone uid
	    (master->get_bb_uid()). Both uids should be a string: if
	    not, the driver in native mode will terminate, else print
	    a warning to stderr. The backbone uid is queried just once
	    at startup.

	    Userids of the Master
	      In compat mode, the master's (e)uid is the (e)uid as
	      determined for every other object as well. The following
	      therefore applies only to !compat mode.

	      The initial (e)uid is those determined using the normal
	      algorithm for newly created objects (see below).
	      After the master being loaded, master->get_root_uid() is
	      called to query the (e)uid to use for real. If the
	      result is a string, it is used as real (e)uid, else the
	      default setting. In native mode, get_root_uid() must
	      return a string, else the driver will terminate.

	    Userids of New Objects
	      If an object has been newly created, it is equipped with
	      a default uid: 0 in !native mode, "NONAME" in native
	      mode. The default euid (if needed) is equal to the uid,
	      or 0 if no master object exists.

	      The basic idea is simple: the master is asked, which (e)uid
	      the new object should have. 
	      Objects loaded by the game, in compat model, or by an
	      object of the same creator will get the suggested e/uid.
	      Backbone objects will get the euid of the loader.
	      Other objects will get 0 as euid.
	      The details are a bit more complicated...:

	      Then master->creator_file() is asked for the 'creator
	      uid' (cuid) of this object. If the lfun doesn't exist,
	      the new object is destructed.
	      The cuid must be a string, the number 0 or an array of
	      two elements, !native mode also allows other non-array
	      values. If the cuid is non of these (native mode
	      restricts this further to the string or array), the
	      object is destructed again.

	      If the cuid is an array of two elements ({ uid, euid }),
	      these are set as e/uid (non-strings are treated as 0).
	      If the cuid is neither string, array or the number 0,
	      the object gets 0 as e/uid (!native mode only).

	      If the cuid is a string (all other cases are treated
	      above) is it always set as the objects uid. The objects
	      euid needs further treatment. If all following cases
	      (checked in the order listed here) fail, it is set to 0.

	      In compat mode, the euid is set to the uid.

	      In !native mode, if the object is loaded (not cloned) or
	      the loader has as 0 uid, the euid is set to the cuid. 
              Also in !native mode, if the loader has a 0 euid, the
              objects euid is set to 0.

	      If the cuid is equal to the loaders uid, the objects
	      euid is set to the cuid == uid.

	      If the cuid is the backbone uid (and in !native mode the
	      loader has a non-zero euid), the objects e/uid are both
	      set to the loaders euid.

	  ------

	  Now you know another reason why 'effective userids' are a
	  bad idea.
