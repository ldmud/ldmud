Source code copyright 1995 by Brian Gerst (Garion@Timewarp).
Based on the standard erq demon for LPmud 3.2.1 by Joern Rennecke.

created from the same source code.

******************************

This is a replacement for the erq demon that comes standard with the
Amylaar 3.2.1 driver.  It differs from the standard erq in that it 
doesn't make use of subservers, which can cause zombie processes.

You need gcc or another ansi compatible compiler.

I know that it works under linux, and at least compiles under sunos, but
I don't have access to any other platform to test.

To compile, run Configure, then run make.

The patch to the the driver is optional, but it allows for a greater
throughput from the driver to the erq demon.

The socketd will need the following privileges from
master->privilege_violation():
  "erq"
  "bind_lambda"

Any bug/questions/comments, mail to bgerst@quark.gmi.edu.
