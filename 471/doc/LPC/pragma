NAME
        pragma

DESCRIPTION
        The preprocessor directive #pragma can be used to select
        several compilation options. Multiple options can be selected
        in one #pragma directive by separating them with commas.

        combine_strings: Perform the addition of string literals at
                compile time instead of run time, e.g. "foo"+"bar"
                will be compiled as "foobar". Like the concatenation
                of adjacent string literals ("foo" "bar" is compiled
                as "foobar" as well) already done by the preprocessor,
                the combine_strings will save memory, because the combined
                strings can be shared betweena blueprint and it's clones,
                and the strings also have a good chance to be entered
                into the global shared-string-table.
        no_combine_string: Contrary to combine_strings, may be used to
                deactivate a combine_strings pragma.

        no_clone: The blueprint object can't be cloned.
        no_inherit: The program can't be inherited.
        no_shadow: The program can't be shadowed (similar to declaring
                all functions as 'nomask').

        weak_types: no type checking (this is the default).
        strict_types: all functions must be declared with argument
                prototypes, and the return values of call_other() must
                be casted.
        strong_types: all functions must be declared with complete
                types of returnvalue and parameters.
        save_types: the declaration data is kept after compilation and
                checked at runtime. This is important for type-safe
                inheritance.

        verbose_errors: upon a compilation error, the driver displays
                the actual context of the errorenous text. This is
                helpful with errors within long expressions.

        no_local_scopes, local_scopes: when local scoping is turned
                off, local variables are visible even outside
                their defining blocks. The setting of this pragma is
                considered upon entry into a function only. By default,
                local scoping is on.
        local_scopes: local variables are visible only inside their
                defining blocks.

        pedantic: Certain warnings are treated as errors:
                - failure to pass enough arguments to simul efuns
        sloppy: Turns off pedantic (the default).
        
        warn_deprecated: Use of deprecated efuns causes the compiler
                to issue a warning.
        no_warn_deprecated: Turns off warn_deprecated (the default).

        When an object is compiled with type testing (#pragma
        strict_types), all types are saved of the arguments for that
        function during compilation.  If the #pragma save_types is
        specified, then the types are saved even after compilation, to
        be used when the object is inherited.

        The following two pragmas are available if the driver was
        compiled with DEBUG and TRACE_CODE options:

        set_code_window: Sets an offset to the current program writing
                position. Use this BEFORE a piece of code where you
                want to check to what bytecodes it is compiled.
        show_code_window: shows some bytes starting at or near the
                last point set_code_window was called.

EXAMPLES
        #pragma strict_types
        #pragma no_clone, no_inherit

HISTORY
        LDMud 3.2.7 added local_scopes, no_local_scopes, no_clone
        and no_inherit.
        LDMud 3.2.8 added weak_types, pedantic and sloppy.
        LDMud 3.2.9 allowed to specify multiple pragmas in one directive,
          and added (no_)warn_deprecated.
