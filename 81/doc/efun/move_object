SYNOPSIS
	void move_object(mixed item, mixed dest)

	item->move(object dest, string methods)

DESCRIPTION
	The item, which can be a file_name or an object, is moved into
	it's new environment dest, which can also be file_name or an
	object.	

	In native mode, the only object that can be moved with
	move_object() is the calling object itself. This function is
	only used to implement an appropriate lfun, traditionally
	called move(). To actually move an object in native mode, use
	its lfun instead, usually by inheriting standard objects.
	This way the moved object has full control over its movement.

	Since 3.2.1, the innards of move_object() are implemented in
	the mudlib, using the M_MOVE_OBJECT driver hooks.
