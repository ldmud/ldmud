SYNOPSIS
	string *explode(string str, string del)

DESCRIPTION
	Return an array of strings, created when the string str is
      split into substrings as divided by del.

EXAMPLES
	string *strs;
	strs = explode(" ab cd ef ", " ");
	
	This will return an array with five strings ({""
	"ab","cd","ef" ""}).

	Not that the behaviour has changed at some point. In former
	times it used to be an array with three strings
	({"ab","cd","ef"}), i.e. the empty strings were ignored.
	The new behaviour is more consistent, because now
	implode(explode(stri, "c"), "c") == str is always true.
	
	strs=explode("abc", "abc");   returns ({"",""})
	
	explode("", "")		      returns ({}).
	
	strs = explode("abc", "xyz"); returns ({ "abc" })
	strs = explode("abc", "");    returns ({"a","b","c"})
