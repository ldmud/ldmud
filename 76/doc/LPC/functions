CONCEPT
	functions

DESCRIPTION
	A locally defined function (a member function of an object)
	can have any number of arguments.
	All types can be sent in the argument. A return value is
	sent with the 'return' statement.

	Uninitialized arguments are set to 0.

	Functions are reentrant.

	If there is no return statement, the number 0 will be returned.

	function_name(argument1, argument2 ...) {
	    statements;
	    ...
	    return value;
	}

	Functions in other objects can be called with 'call_other(ob,
	"fun", arg...)'.
	This an also be written 'ob->fun(arg...)', which is nicer
	syntax.

	A function can have the type 'static', and it will not be
	possible to call with call_other() from another object.

NOTE
	The above descrition seems to from the very beginning of LPC.
	Nowadays functions can also be declared and defined with full
	argument protoypes, like in ANSI C.

	Global variables and functions in an object can have the type
	modifiers 'public', 'static', 'private', 'protected'.

	Private variables and functions can not be accessed by
	objects that inherit the object where the variable is defined
	(this actually works since 3.2@258).

	Static functions cannot be called via call_other(), filter_*()
	or map_*() from other objects. Static variables will not be
	saved by save_object(), or restored by restore_object().

	Functions and Variables that are declared as public cannot be
	made static or private by inheriting objects.

	It is also possible to specify the treatmet of the inherited
	variables and functions in the inherit statement, e.g.:

		private variables static functions inherit "/foo/bar";

	The type modfifier 'protected' is currently unused.

	Functions that are declared as ``nomask'' cannot be overloaded
	by a inheriting program.
	
	Functions which are declared as 'varargs' can accept a variable
	number of arguments
