Starting out in LP-mud:

OK, basically what you want to do is get experience and gold coins.  You do
this by solving puzzles, killing monsters, and selling (after finding)
treasures.

You can move around with normal "e,w,n,s,u,d" types of commands.  There are
also longer commands, like "get shield", "wear shield", "wield axe", and
commands that are for specific places or objects like "push button", "open
safe", "eat cake" and so on.

Killing monsters is a lot easier with a weapon and some armor (and realize
that you must wield and wear those, respectively).  If the monster doesn't
attack you first, you can type something like "kill orc" and you'll start
fighting.

If you get killed, you lose a quarter of your experience, and must go to the
endoplasmatorium to regenerate.  Try not to have this happen.  Type "help
wimpy" to get an idea on how to avoid this, and "help dying" for details. Also,
"score" will tell you how you're doing as far as health, intoxication, etc.

type "help" for a basic list of commands.  Have fun!
