EXPERIENCE

You get experience mostly from killing monsters.  You can also get
experience from solving some puzzles, and you'll usually be told when you've
received experience this way.  Note that while you get a little experience
for just fighting the monster (1 point per h.p. of damage you do) you get
most of your experience for the actual kill.  Please note that you do *not*
get any significant experience for killing other players!

You can also "buy" experience.  When you go to the guild to advance, you
have the option of making up any difference between the needed experience
and the experience you have with cash.  If you have the amount of experience
you need, then you can advance for free.
