int transfer(item, dest)
object item;
object dest;

Move the object "item" to the object "dest". All kinds of tests are done,
and a number is returned specifying the result:

0: Success.
1: Too heavy for destination.
2: Can't be dropped.
3: Can't take it out of it's container.
4: The object can't be inserted into bags etc.
5: The destination doesn't allow insertions of objects.
6: The object can't be picked up.

If an object is transfered to a newly created object, make sure that the
new object first is transfered to it's destination.
