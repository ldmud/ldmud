object present(str, ob)
string str;
object ob;

If an object that identifies to the name "str" is present,
then return it.

'str' can also be an object.

The object is searched for in the inventory of the current object, and
in the inventory of the environment of the current object.

A second optional argument 'ob' is the environent where the search for the
'str' is done. Normally 'this_player()' is a good environment.
