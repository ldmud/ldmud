void say(str,obj)
string str;
object obj;

Send a message "str" to all players in the same object (room).  This
function is also used by the "say" command.  If the optional second argument
is given, then "str" is sent to all except that object.

This commands behaves differently if called from a heart_beat(), or otherwise.
When called from a heart_beat(), the message will reach all players in
the same environment of the object that calls say().

See also write(), shout(), tell().
