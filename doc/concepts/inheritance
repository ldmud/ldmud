CONCEPT
        inheritance

DESCRIPTION
        An object can inherit all variables and functions from another
        object. This is done with the declaration 'inherit "file";'.
        This must come before any local variables or functions.

        An example, defining a monster:

        inherit "obj/monster";

        reset(arg) {
            ::reset(arg);
            set_name("troll");
            set_level(9);
            set_hp(100);
            set_wc(12);
            set_al(-60);
            set_short("A troll");
            set_long("It is a nasty troll that looks very aggressive.\n");
            set_aggressive(1);
        }

NOTE
        Nowadays, inheritance has much more things to offer.
        Description will follow eventually.
