PRELIMINARY

        python

DESCRIPTION
        Python can be used to extend the LDMud driver. At the startup
        of LDMud a python script will be called that can register
        additional efuns. The python script can either be given
        on the command line using the --python-script option,
        or at compile time with the --with-python-script configuration
        option.

        The python script can import the builtin ldmud module for
        extending LDMud and accessing LDMud information.

STARTUP SCRIPT
        The startup script can be a single Python script file. This script
        is executed as the main routine (i.e. __name__ == '__main__') when
        ldmud starts and before the master object is loaded.

        It's also possible to specify a package with a __main__ module
        (currently this may be a directory or a zip file). In this case
        the __main__ submodule will be executed at startup. The package
        itself will be placed into sys.path, so additional content can
        be imported.

LDMUD MODULE
        The ldmud module is only available for Python programs executed
        inside the ldmud process and provides the following functions:

          - register_efun(name, function) -> None
                Registers a new efun name. This is not allowed during
                compilation of an LPC object.

                If the Python function has type annotations for its
                arguments and return value, the type is checked
                at compile and runtime. Union types can be specified
                as tuples of types.

          - unregister_efun(name) -> None
                Removes a python efun from registration. This is not
                allowed during compilation of an LPC object. The
                removal will only affect newly compiled code,
                already compiled code will produce errors when
                calling this efun.

          - register_type(name, class) -> None
                Registers a type for use in LPC. This is not allowed
                during compilation of an LPC object.

                The type name will then be regarded as a reserved word
                when compiling LPC code and can be used as a regular
                LPC type. To actually create objects of the types,
                additional registration of corresponding efuns is needed.

                For details about the usage, see PYTHON TYPES below.

          - unregister_type(name) -> None
                Removes a python type from registration. This is not
                allowed during compilation of an LPC object. The removal
                will only affect newly compiled code. Already compiled
                code will still work afterwards.

          - register_socket(fd, function [,eventmask]) -> None
                Registers a socket <fd> to watch for events (like
                poll/select). The socket must be either given as
                an integer or an object with a fileno() method
                returning an integer. The function must be a callable
                accepting one argument, the actual event mask.
                <eventmask> may be an combination of select.POLLIN,
                select.POLLOUT and select.POLLPRI or a callable
                returning such a combination.

          - unregister_socket(fd) -> None
                Removes a previously registered socket from the
                watch list.

          - register_hook(hook, function) -> None
                Register a hook. The python function will be called
                whenever <hook> happens. <hook> can be one of the
                following:

                  ON_HEARTBEAT
                    Called without arguments for every backend loop

                  ON_OBJECT_CREATED
                    Called whenever an object was created, with the
                    object as its first and only argument. This call
                    happens before any LPC code of the object ran.

                  ON_OBJECT_DESTRUCTED
                    Called just before an object will be destructed,
                    with the object as its first and only argument.

                  ON_CHILD_PROCESS_TERMINATED
                    Called without any arguments whenever a SIGCHLD signal
                    was received. This could also happen for processes
                    spawned by the driver itself (eg. erq).

                  ON_SIGINT
                    Called without any argument whenever a SIGINT signal
                    was received. (This is just informative, the driver
                    will execute the DC_SIGACTION_SIGINT action also.)

                  ON_SIGTERM
                    Called without any argument whenever a SIGTERM signal
                    was received. The driver will terminate afterwards.

                  ON_SIGHUP
                    Called without any argument whenever a SIGHUP signal
                    was received. (This is just informative, the driver
                    will execute the DC_SIGACTION_SIGHUP action also.)

                  ON_SIGUSR1
                    Called without any argument whenever a SIGUSR1 signal
                    was received. (This is just informative, the driver
                    will execute the DC_SIGACTION_SIGUSR1 action also.)

                  ON_SIGUSR2
                    Called without any argument whenever a SIGUSR2 signal
                    was received. (This is just informative, the driver
                    will execute the DC_SIGACTION_SIGUSR2 action also.)

          - unregister_hook(hook, function) -> None
                Removes a hook function.

          - get_master() - > Object
                Returns the current master object.
                Returns None, if there is no master object (yet).

          - get_simul_efun() - > Object
                Returns the current simul-efun object
                (or None if there is none).

          - LWObject(filename)
                Corresponds to the LPC lwobject type.
                On instantiation a filename of a blueprint to create

                  variables
                      Contains all variables as attributes. They are similar
                      to the same member of the Object type.

                For type checks the type object can be subscripted with a
                filename to create a named lwobject type: LWObject["/name"]

          - Array([values | size])
                Corresponds to an LPC array.
                Can either be initialized with a list of values
                or to a given size.

                Supports element access with [], len() and __contains__.

                For type checks the type object can be subscripted with an
                element type to create a concrete array type: Array[Mapping]

          - Mapping([values | width])
                Corresponds to an LPC mapping.
                Can either be initialized with a dict, a list of tuples
                or as an empty mapping with a given width.

                Supports element access with [], len(), __contains__
                and has a width member.

          - Struct(object, name [, values])
                Corresponds to an LPC struct.
                On initialization the name of the struct definition and
                the correspopnding object is required. It can be initialized
                with a list of values or dict.

                  members
                      Contains all members as attributes. They contain the
                      following attributes:

                          unknown or mixed).

                For type checks the type object can be subscripted to create
                a specific struct type: Struct[program, name], whereas the
                program can be given as a file name or object. When using this
                for creating a struct, only values need to be passed.

          - Closure(object [,name [, lfun_object]])
                Corresponds to an LPC closure.
                On initialization a closure bound to <object> will be created,
                like a call to symbol_function(<name> [, <lfun_object>]).

                Supports function calls.

          - Coroutine()
                Corresponds to an LPC coroutine.
                They can only be created by LPC code and are not compatible
                with Python coroutines.

                Supports function calls and has the following members:

                  object
                      The object the coroutine belongs to.

                  program_name
                      The name of the program that defined the coroutine.

                  function_name
                      The name of the function that defined the coroutine.

                  file_name
                      The name of the file that contains the definition.

                  line_number
                      The current line where the coroutine is suspended.

                  variables
                      Contains all local variables as attributes with
                      their current value.

          - Symbol(name [, quotes])
                Corresponds to an LPC symbol.
                On initialization the name of the symbol is required.
                Optionally the number of quotes (at least 1) can be specified.

                Has two members: name and quotes.

          - QuotedArray(array [, quotes])
                Corresponds to an LPC quoted array.
                On initialization an array is required.
                Optionally the number of quotes (at least 1) can be specified.

                Has two members: array and quotes.

          - Lvalue(value)
                Creates an lvalue reference for the given value.

                Has two member: value and members.

                If the value is an array, mapping or string, then lvalues
                to its elements can be created with [].

                If the value is a struct, then lvalues to its members can
                be created with the members attribute. It contains all
                the struct members as attributes and will return an Lvalue
                object to the struct member.

          - LPCType(type)
                Corresponds to an LPC lpctype value. For basic types this
                is a no-op and returns the basic type. This type will provide
                the corresponding LDMud type object for basic python types,
                and it can be used to construct a union type by passing a
                tuple of types.

                A union type allows iteration over its basic types and
                supports __contains__.

          - Integer, Float, String, Bytes
                These are derived types from Python's int, float, str and
                bytes. They offer the | (or) operator to create union of
                types.


        This module contains the following sub-namespaces:

          - efuns
                This namespace contains all original efuns (without any
                registered Python efuns or simul-efuns). These can be called
                as a regular function.

          - registered_efuns
                Contains all registered Python efuns.

          - registered_types
                Contains all registered Python types.


        There is mapping of LPC values to Python values for the following types:
            int    <-> int(, bool)
            float  <-> float
            string <-> str
            bytes  <-> bytes

        Type definitions are translated in a similar fashion, additionally the
        following mappings are done:
            void   <-> None
            union  <-> tuple of types

PYTHON TYPES
        Without any special functions Python types are treated opaque in LPC.
        There is no introspection available, beside what get_type_info()
        returns, and there is no facility to create those in LPC. Python
        objects need to be created and processed by a registered Python efun.
        But those types can be extended with special functions to make them
        more usable in LPC.

        Regular LPC operations can be applied to those python objects and
        will call the corresponding special member functions. If those
        member functions are not available, the corresponding LPC operations
        aren't either. For compile time type checking those special member
        functions can have type annotations just like efun functions.
        The following operations are supported:
            +, -, *, /, %, <<, >>, &, |, ^, >, >=, ==, !=, <, <=.
        For each operation the lhs function (i.e. __add__), the rhs function
        (i.e. __radd__), and the assignment function (i.e. __iadd__) is
        supported. The rhs function is also supported for the comparison
        operations (i.e. __rlt__, this is a non-standard extension to the
        Python functions).

        Python objects can also extend regular efuns. When the first argument
        to an efun is a Python object, a function named __efun_<name>__ is
        called in the Python object instead (when available). The function
        must accept the same number of arguments as the original efun. (And
        there must not be a registered Python efun of the same name.)

        Additionally a Python type can implement the following support
        functions for LPC efuns:

            __repr__
                Used by sprintf() for printing a Python object.
                Should return a string.

            __copy__
                Used by copy() and deep_copy() for copying a Python object.
                (Deep copying a Python object is currently not supported.)
                Should return a Python object of the same type.

            __save__
                Used by save_value()/save_object() to save a Python object.
                Should return an LPC type (e.g. a string).

            __restore__
                Used by restore_value()/restore_object() to restore a Python
                object. This should be a static method that gets the value
                from __save__ as the only argument and will return the
                restored object.

            __convert__
                Used by to_type() to convert the Python object into another
                type. Gets the target type object as its first argument and
                the to_type_options struct (which may be None) as a second
                argument. If the conversion is not supported, can either
                return None or an exception. Only if the function does not
                exist, __int__, __float__, __str__ or __bytes__ are called
                if appropriate.

EXAMPLE
        import ldmud

        def hello_world(name: str) -> int:
            print("Hello, world, %s!\n" % (name,))
            return 1

        ldmud.register_efun("hello", hello_world)

NOTES
        Just like simul-efuns python efuns can shadow real efuns. The
        original efun is then inaccessible for LPC code (except for code
        that was compiled before the efun was registered). Python efuns are
        nearly indistinguishable from real efuns, they also use the efun::
        prefix. However they can be detected with
            CLOSURE_IS_PYTHON_EFUN(get_type_info(#'efun,1))

        Without the prefix the order of name resolution for function calls is:
         1. lfuns
         2. simul-efuns
         3. python efuns
         4. real efuns

        Also just like simul-efuns python-registered efuns are called
        from LPC code that was compiled after the registration. LPC code
        that was compiled before the registration will still call the
        original efuns (or throw a compile error if that efun doesn't exist).
        Therefore such efuns should be registered in the python startup
        script.

        When a python efun is unregistered, code that was compiled while the
        registration was in effect will throw a runtime error. (Regardless
        of whether a driver efun with the same name exists or not.)

        There is a limit of 2048 python efuns. Not only registered, but also
        formerly registered - but now unregistered - efuns count toward that
        limit. Re-registering the same efun name again won't count a second
        time. (LPC code that was compiled during the previous registration
        will also call the new efun after the re-registration.)

        As LDMud is single-threaded, the python code will run in the same
        thread as the LPC machine. So any long-running python function will
        halt the MUD for all players. Hence python functions should return
        promptly and source out any lengthy tasks to another process. If
        other threads are spawned from python, then these threads are not
        allowed to access any LDMud functions or objects.

        Finally a note of caution: Don't change the meaning of base efuns
        fundamentally as it furthers confusion and hinders exchange of LPC
        code and knowledge between mudlibs.

HISTORY
        LDMud 3.5 implemented the python functionality.
        LDMud 3.6 added type checks.
