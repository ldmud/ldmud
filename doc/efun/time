SYNOPSIS
        int time()

DESCRIPTION
        Return number of seconds ellapsed since 1. Jan 1970, 0.0:0 GMT

        The time is based on the time provided by the host system, however,
        the driver makes sure that the result of time() is monotonically
        increasing (ie. changes only to bigger numbers).

        The result of time() does not change during the course of a command
        execution.

EXAMPLES
        write(ctime(time())+"\n");

        Print out the current date and time.
