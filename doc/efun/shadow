SYNOPSIS
	object shadow(object ob, int flag)

DESCRIPTION
	If flag is non-zero then the current object will shadow ob. If
	flag is 0 then either 0 will be returned or the object that is
	shadowing ob.
	
	The calling object must be permitted by the master object to
	do the shadowing. In most installations, an object that
	defines the function query_prevent_shadow() to return 1
	can't be shadowed, and the shadow() function will return 0
	instead of ob.

	shadow() also fails if the calling object tries to shadow
	a function that was defined as ``nomask'', if the program was
        compiled with the #pragma no_shadow, or if the calling
	object is already shadowing, is being shadowed, or has an
	environment. Also the target ob must not be shadowing
	something else.
	
	If an object A shadows an object B then all call_other() to B
	will be redirected to A. If object A has not defined the
	function, then the call will be passed to B. There is only on
	object that can call functions in B with call_other(), and
	that is A. Not even object B can call_other() itself. All
	normal (internal) function calls inside B will however remain
	internal to B.
	
HISTORY
	Up to 3.2.1@46, destructing a shadowed object also destructs
	all shadows. Since 3.2.1@47, shadows may survive the
	destruction of the shadowee (unless the prepare_destruct() in
	the master object destructs them manually).

        Since LDMud 3.2.8, programs may protect themselves from being
        shadowed with the #pragma no_shadow.
