SYNOPSIS
        int remove_call_out(string fun)
        int remove_call_out(closure fun)

DESCRIPTION
        Remove next pending call-out for function <fun> in the current
        object, resp. the next pending call-out for closure <fun>.
        The time left is returned.

        -1 is returned if there were no call-outs pending to this
        function.

EXAMPLES
        To remove every pending call-out to MyTimer() :

        while (remove_call_out("MyTimer") != -1) /* continue */ ;

BUGS
        The removal of closure call-outs works only if the exact same
        closure value is used.
        This will work:

          closure cl = symbol_function("main", obj);
          call_out(cl, 2);
          remove_call_out(cl);

        This will not work:

          call_out(symbol_function("main", obj), 2);
          remove_call_out(symbol_function("main", obj));


HISTORY
        Removing a call_out to a closure was introduced in 3.2.1@45.
