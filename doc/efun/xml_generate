SYNOPSIS
        #include <xml.h>

        string xml_generate(mixed *xml)

DESCRIPTION
        Converts the given <xml> array into an XML conformant string, if
        possible. The <xml> argument array must have the following structure:

        It must contain tag arrays of three elements, with the following
        indices:

            string XML_TAG_NAME
                The name of the XML tag.

            mapping XML_TAG_ATTRIBUTES
                All attributes given to the XML tag as a mapping where the key
                is the attribute name and the value is its string value.

                If the xml tag does not contain any attributes, this element
                is set to 0:

            mixed * XML_TAG_CONTENTS
                The contents of this xml tag as an array. This array may
                contain either strings, or arrays of sub-tags again with
                three elements. (see example)

                If the xml tag does not contain anything, the element is
                set to 0.

        In case the parameter does not follow these rules, errors are raised.
        The method returns a valid XML string otherwise.

        The function is available only if the driver is compiled with Iksemel
        support. In that case, __XML_DOM__ is defined.


EXAMPLES
        xml_generate(({ "abc", 0, 0 })) -> "<abc/>"
        xml_generate(({ "abc", ([ "xyz" : "cde" ]), 0 })) -> "<abc xyz="cde"/>"

        mixed *xml = ({ "book"
                      , ([ "language" : "common" ])
                      , ({ ({ "title"
                            , 0
                            , ({ "This is a title" })
                           })
                         , ({ "chapter"
                            , 0
                            , ({ "This is a chapter" })
                           })
                         , ({ "chapter"
                            , 0
                            , ({ "We want "
                               , ({ "b"
                                  , 0
                                  , ({ "bold" })
                                 })
                               , "here"
                              })
                           })
                        })
                     })

        xml_generate(xml)
            -> "<book language="common"><title>This is the title</title>"
               "<chapter>This is a chapter</chapter><chapter>We want "
               "<b>bold</b> here.</chapter></book>"
