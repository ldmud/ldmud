SYNOPSIS
        void throw(mixed arg)

DESCRIPTION
        Abort execution. If the current program execution was
        initiated by catch(), that catch expression will
        return <arg> as error code.

        Calling throw() without previous catch() does not make sense
        and will result in a "Throw with no catch." error.

EXAMPLES
        catch(throw("aborting execution"));
        This will just print the string "aborting execution".

SEE ALSO
        catch(E), raise_error(E)
