PRELIMINARY
SYNOPSIS
        void tls_deinit_connection(object ob)

DESCRIPTION
        tls_deinit_connection() shuts down a TLS connection to
        the interactive object <ob> (or this_object() if <ob> is not
        given) but the connection is not closed.

        Under normal circumstances there is no need to use this efun: most
        clients operate in either secure or unsecure mode, but don't allow
        switching connection security on the fly.

HISTORY
        Introduced in LDMud 3.3.474 and later backported to 3.2.11.
