SYNOPSIS
        void tell_room(string|object ob, string str)
        void tell_room(string|object ob, string str, object *exclude)

        void tell_room(string|object ob, mixed *|mapping|struct|object msg)
        void tell_room(string|object ob, mixed *|mapping|struct|object msg,
                       object *exclude)

DESCRIPTION
        Send a message <str> to all living objects in the room <ob>. <ob>
        can also be the name of the room given as a string. If a
        receiving object is not an interactive user, the lfun
        catch_tell() of the object will be invoked with the message as
        argument. If living objects define catch_tell(), the string
        will also be sent to that instead of being written to the user.
        If <ob> is given by filename, the driver looks up the object
        under that name, loading it if necessary. If array *<exclude> is
        given, all objects contained in *<exclude> are excluded from the
        message str.

        If the second arg is an array/mapping/struct/object, catch_msg() will
        be called in all listening living objects.

EXAMPLES
        tell_object(environment(this_player()), "Hi!\n");

        Just send a simple "Hi!" to all livings in the current.

        Object 1 (living):
           void catch_tell(string str) {
              write("Received: "+str+"\n");
           }
        Object 2:
           void func() {
              ...
              tell_room(environment(this_player()), "HiHo!\n");
              ...
           }

        This example shows how tell_room() works with catch_tell().

HISTORY
        LDMud 3.3.686 added the use of a mapping/struct/object as second
        argument.
