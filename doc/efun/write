SYNOPSIS
        void write(mixed msg)

DESCRIPTION
        Write out something to the current user. What exactly will
        be printed in the end depends of the type of msg.

        If it is a string or a number then just prints it out.

        If it is an object then the object will be printed in the
        form: "OBJ("+object_name((object)mix)+")"

        If it is an array just "<ARRAY>" will be printed.
        If it is a mapping just "<MAPPING>" will be printed.
        If it is a closure just "<CLOSURE>" will be printed.

        If the write() function is invoked by a command of a living,
        non-interactive object and the given argument is a string
        then the lfun catch_tell() of the living will be invoked with
        the message as argument.

EXAMPLES
        write("Hello world!\n");

        Just print out a string.

        write(this_player());

        This will print out something like "OBJ(std/player#1234)".

        write( ({ "blub" }) );

        Will print out "<ARRAY>".
