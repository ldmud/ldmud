SYNOPSIS
	void set_combine_charset (int* bitvector)
	void set_combine_charset (string charset)

DESCRIPTION
        Set the set of characters which can be combined into a single string
        when already received en-bloc in charmode from the current interactive
        user.

        Non-combinable characters and single received characters are returned
        as separate strings as usual. The function must be called with the
        interactive user being the command giver.
 
        The newline '\n' and the NUL character '\0' are always non-combinable.
 
        The charset can be given either directly as a string, or indirectly
        as a bitvector.
 
        The bitvector is interpreted as an array of 8-bit-values and might
        contain up to 32 elements. Character n is allowed to be output
        if sizeof(bitvector) > n/8 && bitvector[n/8] & (1 << n%8) .


EXAMPLE
        // In a screen-oriented editor, most of the printable characters
        // (excluding answers to editor prompts 'j', 'n' and 'q') can be
        // combined into strings.
        set_combine_charset("abcdefghijklmoprstuvwxz0123456789"
                            "ABCDEFGHIJKLMOPRSTUVWXZ");

        // Disable any previous setting.
        set_combine_charset("");
