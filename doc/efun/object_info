SYNOPSIS
        #include <objectinfo.h>

        mixed * object_info(object ob, int what)
        mixed * object_info(object ob, int what, int index)

DESCRIPTION
        Returns some internal information about object <ob>, collected
        in an array. Argument <what> determines which information is
        returned.

        The result is usually an array. However, if <index> is specified,
        the result is the value from position <index> of the array which
        would have been returned normally.

        The possible values of <what>, and the indices of the returned
        arrays are defined in the include file <objectinfo.h>, and may
        change in future versions of the driver!


        <what> == OINFO_BASIC:

          This call returns basic information about <ob>:

          int [OIB_IS_WIZARD]:        1 if <ob> has the wizard flag set,
                                        0 else.
            This entry is always 0 when set_is_wizard() is not available.

          int [OIB_LAMBDA_REFERENCED]: 1 if <ob> has lambdas, 0 else.
          int [OIB_SHADOW]:           1 if <ob> has a shadow structure tied
                                        to it, 0 if not.
          int [OIB_REPLACED]:         1 if the program for <ob> was replaced,
                                      0 else.
          int [OIB_TOTAL_LIGHT]:  the amount of light <ob> is emitting.
            This entry is always 0 when set_light() is not available.

          int [OIB_REF]:          number of references to <ob>
          int [OIB_GIGATICKS] and [OIB_TICKS]: together, these numbers
            give the accumulated evaluation cost spend in <ob>
          int [OIB_SWAP_NUM]:     the swap number for <ob>s program,

          object [OIB_NEXT_ALL]:  next object in the object list.
          object [OIB_PREV_ALL]:  previous object in the object list.


        <what> == OINFO_POSITION:

          This call returns information about <ob>'s position in the
          global list of objects:

          object [OIP_NEXT]: next object in the object list.
          object [OIP_PREV]: previous object in the object list.
          int    [OIP_POS]:  position of <ob> in list, counting from 0 up.

          This call can be expensive in computing time.


        <what> == OINFO_MEMORY:

          This call returns information about the program <ob> uses:

          int    [OIM_REF]:            number of references to the program.
          string [OIM_NAME]:           name of program.

          int    [OIM_SIZE_STRINGS]:   size needed for the string pointers.
          int    [OIM_SIZE_STRINGS_DATA]: size needed for the string data,
                                       scaled down according to the extend of
                                       data sharing.
          int    [OIM_SIZE_STRINGS_TOTAL]: unmodified size needed for the

          int    [OIM_SIZE_INHERITED]: size needed for the inherit structs.
          int    [OIM_TOTAL_SIZE]:     total size of the program.
          int    [OIM_DATA_SIZE]:      total size of the values held in the
                                       object's variables, scaled down
                                       according to the extend of data
                                       sharing.
          int    [OIM_DATA_SIZE_TOTAL]: unmodified total size of the values
                                       held in the object's variables
          int    [OIM_NO_INHERIT]:     1 if the program can't be inherited.
          int    [OIM_NO_CLONE]:       1 if the program/blueprint can't be
                                       cloned.
          int    [OIM_NO_SHADOW]:      1 if the program's functions can't be

                                       their initial variable values with
                                       the blueprint.

          This call swaps in the program if necessary.
          Note that the OIM_SIZE_xxx entries only give the size spent on
          the structures and pointers, not the size of the variable data,
          function code, and strings themselves.

HISTORY

        Changes in LDMud 3.2.7:
          - new basic result OIB_REPLACED.
          - basic result OIB_IS_WIZARD is always 0 if set_is_wizard()

          - basic result OIB_APPROVED is gone.
        LDMud 3.2.8 added OIM_DATA_SIZE to the result of OINFO_MEMORY.
        LDMud 3.2.9 added the index mechanism, OIM_NUM_INCLUDES,
          OIM_NO_INHERIT, OIM_NO_SHADOW, OIM_NO_CLONE, OIM_SIZE_STRINGS_DATA,
          OIM_SIZE_STRINGS_TOTAL, and OIM_DATA_SIZE_TOTAL to the result

        LDMud 3.3.378 added the OIM_SHARE_VARIABLES to the result
          of OINFO_MEMORY.
