PRELIMINARY
SYNOPSIS
        object present_clone(string str)
        object present_clone(string str, object env)
  
        object present_clone(object obj)
        object present_clone(object obj, object env)

DESCRIPTION
        This efun searches the inventory of object <env> (default is the
        current object) for an object with a specific blueprint. The first
        object found is returned, otherwise the result is 0.

        The blueprint can be specified either by name <str>, or as the same
        blueprint as of object <obj>. The matching criteria in both cases is
        the load_name().

        For plain driver this name starts with a '/', for COMPAT mode
        drivers it doesn't.

        Note that in contrast to present(), this efun never searches
        in the environment of <env>.

EXAMPLES
        Assume that object 'env' contains the objects /obj/money#8,
        /std/weapon#9, /std/weapon#12 and /obj/key in the given order.

          present_clone("/obj/money", env)     --> /obj/money#8
          present_clone("/std/weapon#12", env) --> /std/weapon#9
          present_clone(find_object("/obj/money#14"), env)
                                               --> /obj/money#8
          present_clone("/obj/key#18", env)    --> /obj/key

        For compat-mode drivers, remove the leading '/' from the given
        names.
