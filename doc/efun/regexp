SYNOPSIS
	string *regexp(string *list, string pattern)

DESCRIPTION
	Match the pattern pattern against all strings in list, and
	return a new array with all strings that matched. This
	function uses the same syntax for regular expressions as ed():
	
	. Match any character.
	
	^ Match begin of line.
	
	$ Match end of line.
	
	\< Match begin of word.
	
	\> Match end of word.

	\B not at edge of a word (supposed to be like the emacs
	   compatibility one in gnu egrep), since 3.2@249

	x|y Match regexp x or regexp y.
	
	() Match enclosed regexp like a 'simple' one.
	
	x* Match any number (0 or more) of regexp x.

	x+ Match any number (1 or more) of regexp x.
	
	[..] Match one of the characters enclosed.
	
	[^ ..] Match none of the characters enclosed. The .. are to
	replaced by single characters or character ranges:
	[abc] matches a, b or c.
	[ab0-9] matches a, b or any digit.
	[^a-z] does not match any lowercase character.
	
	\c match character c even if it's one of the special characters.
	
	If there is an error in the regular expression 0 will be
	returned.  Remember that the character "\" has to be escaped
	with a "\" when written as a LPC string.

EXAMPLE
	string strs;
	if (strs = regexp( ({"please, help me Sir John."}),
				 "\\<help\\>.*\\<me\\>"))
	   if (sizeof(strs)
	      write("It matches.\n");
	
	The regular expression will test the given string (which is
	packed into an array) if there is something like "help ... me"
	inside of it.
	
HISTORY
        LDMud 3.2.9 added metacharacter '+'.
