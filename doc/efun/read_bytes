SYNOPSIS
        bytes read_bytes(string file, int start, int number)

DESCRIPTION
        Reads a given amount of bytes from file.
        If <start> is not given or 0, the file is read from the
        beginning, else from the <start>th byte on. If <start> is
        negative, it is counted from the end of the file. If counting
        from the end of the file would extend beyond the beginning of
        the file the file is read fronm the beginning. <number> is the 
        number of bytes to read. 0 or negative values are possible, but not
        useful. If <start> would be outside the end of the file, 0 is
        returned instead of a string.

        The maximum bytes being read per call is LIMIT_BYTE (see
        query_limits()).

HISTORY
        LDMud 3.X.X added support for start offsets before the beginning 
        of the file.
