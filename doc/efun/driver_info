SYNOPSIS
        #include <driver_info.h>

        mixed driver_info(int what)

DESCRIPTION
        Returns some internal information about the driver.
        The argument <what> determines which information is returned.

        It can be either a configuration option as given to
        configure_driver() or one of the following options:



        Driver Environment:

        <what> == DI_BOOT_TIME:
          The time() when the driver was started.



        LPC Runtime status:

        <what> == DI_CURRENT_RUNTIME_LIMITS:
          Return an array with the current runtime limits.
          The entries in the returned array are:

            int[LIMIT_EVAL]:         the max number of eval costs
            int[LIMIT_ARRAY]:        the max number of array entries
            int[LIMIT_MAPPING_SIZE]: the max number of mapping values
            int[LIMIT_MAPPING_KEYS]: the max number of mapping entries
               (LIMIT_MAPPING is an alias for LIMIT_MAPPING_KEYS)
            int[LIMIT_BYTE]:         the max number of bytes handled with
                                     one read_bytes()/write_bytes() call.
            int[LIMIT_FILE]:         the max number of bytes handled with
                                     one read_file()/write_file() call.
            int[LIMIT_CALLOUTS]:     the number of callouts at one time.
            int[LIMIT_COST]:         how to account the current cost.
            int[LIMIT_MEMROY]:       the max. number of bytes which can be 
                                     _additionally_ allocated/used 
                                     _per top-level execution thread_

          For all limits except LIMIT_COST a limit of '0' aka LIMIT_UNLIMITED
          means 'no limit'.

          The value for LIMIT_COST has these meanings:

            value > 0: the execution will cost minimum(<value>, actual cost) .
            value = 0: if the current LIMIT_EVAL is larger than the calling
                       LIMIT_EVAL, the evaluation will cost only 10; otherwise
                       the full cost will be accounted.
            value < 0: (-value)% of the current evaluation cost will be
                       accounted; -100 obviously means 'full cost'.

        <what> == DI_EVAL_NUMBER:
          Return the current evaluation number.
          The number is incremented for each top-level call. Top-level
          calls are initiated by the driver, usually in reaction to an
          external event:
              - commands (added by add_action)
              - heart_beat, reset, clean_up
              - calls from call_out or input_to
              - master applies triggered by external events
              - calls of driver hooks in reaction to external events
              - send_erq callbacks
              - logon in interactives

          The number can be used to detect cases where the same code is
          executed twice in the same top level evaluation (say, heart_beat),
          and also for time stamps for ordering some events.

          Please note that the counter may overflow, especially on 32 bit
          systems. As a result, it can also be negative.



        Network configuration:

        <what> == DI_MUD_PORTS:
          Returns an array with all open ports, which the driver
          listens for player connections on.

        <what> == DI_UDP_PORT:
          Returns the port number of the UDP socket.



        Memory management:

        <what> == DI_MEMORY_RESERVE_USER:
          Current size of the user memory reserve.
          The user memory reserve is allocated at startup and is used
          when the driver runs out of memory.

        <what> == DI_MEMORY_RESERVE_MASTER:
          Current size of the master memory reserve.
          The master memory reserve is allocated at startup and is used
          when the driver runs out of memory while executing master
          code.

        <what> == DI_MEMORY_RESERVE_SYSTEM:
          Current size of the system memory reserve.
          The system memory reserve is allocated at startup and is used
          when the driver runs out of memory while executing internal
          operations.



        Traces:

        <what> == DI_TRACE_CURRENT:
          Returns the current stack trace in array form.

          If the array has more than one entries, the first entry is 0 or
          the name of the object with the heartbeat which started the
          current thread; all following entries describe the call stack
          starting with the topmost function called.

          All call entries are arrays themselves with the following elements:

                   TRACE_TYPE_EFUN   (2): an efun closure.
                   TRACE_TYPE_LAMBDA (3): a lambda closure.
                   TRACE_TYPE_LFUN   (4): a normal lfun.

               mixed[TRACE_NAME]: The 'name' of the called frame:
                   _TYPE_EFUN:   either the name of the efun, or the code of
                                 the instruction for operator closures
                   _TYPE_LAMBDA: the numeric lambda identifier.
                   _TYPE_LFUN:   the name of the lfun.

               string[TRACE_PROGRAM]: The (file)name of the program holding
                                      the code.

               string[TRACE_OBJECT]:  The name of the object for which the code
                                      was executed. For lightweight objects
                                      this is 0.

               int[TRACE_LOC]:
                   _TYPE_LAMBDA: current program offset from the start of the
                                 closure code.

        <what> == DI_MEMORY_EXTENDED_STATISTICS:
          If the driver was compiled with extended memory statistics,
          they are returned in this entry; if the driver was compiled
          without the statistics, 0 is returned.

          The array contains NUM+2 entries, where NUM is the number
          of distinct small block sizes. Entry [NUM] describes the
          statistics of oversized small blocks (smalloc) resp. for
          all slabs (slaballoc), entry [NUM+1] summarizes all large
          blocks. Each entry is an array of these fields:

               int DIM_ES_MAX_ALLOC:
                       Max number of allocated blocks of this size.

               int DIM_ES_CUR_ALLOC:
                       Current number of allocated blocks of this size.

               int DIM_ES_MAX_FREE:
                       Max number of allocated blocks of this size.

               int DIM_ES_CUR_FREE:
                       Current number of allocated blocks of this size.

               float DIM_ES_AVG_XALLOC:
                       Number of explicit allocation requests per
                       second.

               float DIM_ES_AVG_XFREE:
                       Number of explicit deallocation requests per
                       second.

               int DIM_ES_FULL_SLABS:
                       Number of fully used slabs (slaballoc only).

               int DIM_ES_FREE_SLABS:
                       Number of fully free slabs (slaballoc only).

               int DIM_ES_TOTAL_SLABS:
                       Total number of slabs: partially used, fully used
                       and fully free (slaballoc only).

           The allocation/deallocation-per-second statistics do
           not cover internal shuffling of the freelists.

           The slab statistics (entry [NUM], slaballoc only) shows
           in the AVG statistics the frequence with which slabs were
           allocated from resp. returned to the large memory pool.
