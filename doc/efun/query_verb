SYNOPSIS
        string query_verb(void)

DESCRIPTION
        Give the name of the current command, or 0 if not executing
        from a command. This allows add_action() of several commands
        to the same function. query_verb() returns 0 when invoked by a
        function which was started by a call_out or the heart beat.
        Also when a user logs in query_verb() returns 0.

        The string returned is always the first word from the line
        input by the player, up to but not including the first space
        (or lineend).

EXAMPLE
        void init() {
           ...
           add_action("sing","sing");
           ...
        }
        int sing(string str) {
           write("Your command was:"+query_verb()+(str ? str : "")+"\n");
           return 1;
        }
        
        When ever you type "sing ..." you get "Your command was: sing ...".
