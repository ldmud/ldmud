SYNOPSIS
	void call_out(string fun, int delay, mixed arg, ...)
	void call_out(closure cl, int delay, mixed arg, ...)

DESCRIPTION
	Set up a call to function fun or closure cl in the current
	object. The call will take place in delay seconds, with the
	remaining argument list provided. delay can be a minimum time
	of one second.
	
	call_out() saves and restores the current user. It is now
	possible to use say() or write() which rely on a current
	user to be something useful.

        call_out() can only call functions which are publicly accessible,
        i.e. "public" and "static" functions. "private" and "protected"
        functions can't be called.

	The execution of the call_out()s implies a simple (not
	exhaustive) measure against rabbits: the evaluation costs of
	those call_outs() executing at the same time are summed up on
	a per-user base. If the summed-up costs exceed the given maximum,
	a 'too long evaluation' error will occur and any remaining
	call_outs() of this user scheduled for the same time are
	discarded.

EXAMPLE
	call_out("RefreshMe", 10);
	
	This will call the function RefreshMe() in 10 seconds without
	any arguments. The function RefreshMe() can then call out
	itself again which will result in a loop (not in a recursion)
	which can be used to check or set up things in the object in
	intervals. Be aware that callouts are stored in a linear
	list, and so are somewhat expensive for the driver.

	And YES: self-replicating call_out()s, where each call_out()
	creates two or more other call_out()s in a loop (so called
	'rabbits') slow the mud down very fast, and are even able
	to crash it. No need to try it yourself.
