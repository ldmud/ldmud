SYNOPSIS
        void tell_object(object|string ob, string str)
        void tell_object(object|string ob, mixed *|mapping|struct|object msg)

DESCRIPTION
        Send a message <str> to object <ob> (which is looked up and loaded
        by given name if necessary).

        If the second argument is a string, the message will be printed
        to <ob> if it is an interactive user, otherwise it will be passed to
        the lfun catch_tell() on the target living object.

        If the second argument is an array/mapping/struct/object, it will be
        passed to the lfun catch_msg() on the target.

EXAMPLES
        object who;
        who=find_player("wessex");
        tell_object(who, "Hi!\n");

        Just tell Wessex a simple "Hi!".


        Object 1 (living with the name "dummymonster"):
           void catch_tell(string str) {
              write("Received: "+str+"\n");
           }
        Object 2:
           void func() {
              object who;
              who=find_living("dummymonster");
              tell_object(who, "Follow me, mortal one!\n");
              ...
           }

        This examples shows how tell_object() works with catch_tell().

HISTORY
        LDMud 3.2.11 introduced the 'mixed *' form for symmetry reasons.
        LDMud 3.3.686 added the use of a mapping/struct/object as second
        argument.
