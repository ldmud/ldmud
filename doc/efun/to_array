SYNOPSIS
        mixed * to_array(string)
        mixed * to_array(bytes)
        mixed * to_array(symbol)
        mixed * to_array(quotedarray)
        mixed * to_array(mixed *)
        mixed * to_array(struct)
        mixed * to_array(lpctype)

        (int*)<value>

DESCRIPTION
        Strings and symbols are converted to an int array that
        consists of the args characters. Note that the string "12" will be
        converted to the array ({ 33, 34 }), and not ({ 33, 34, 0 }) (the
        LDMud versions prior to 3.3 returned the latter array).

        Byte sequences are converted into an array of these bytes.

        Quoted arrays are ``dequoted'', and arrays are left as they
        are.

        Structs are converted into a normal array.

        Union lpc types are split into their union member types
        (in no particular order).

BUGS
        The cast notation only works if the precise type of <value>
        is known at compile-time. This will not be fixed - use the
        function form instead.

HISTORY
        LDMud 3.3.250 added structs to the accepted data types.
