SYNOPSIS
	object *caller_stack()
	object *caller_stack(int add_interactive)

DESCRIPTION
	Returns an array of the previous_object()s who caused the
	call_other() to this_object().
	previous_object(i) equals caller_stack()[i].
	
	If you pass the optional argument <add_interactive> (as true value)
	this_interactive() is appended to the array, or 0 if there is no
        current interactive.

EXAMPLE
	interactive object A enters a command which causes
	a call to a function in object B, that one calls a
	function in object C and that, in turn, in object D

	If D now calls caller_stack() the result would be: ({C,B}).
	If it calls caller_stack(1) the result is: ({C,B,A}).

HISTORY
	Introduced in LDMud 3.2.6, suggested by TubMud.
