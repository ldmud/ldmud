SYNOPSIS
        #include <driver_hook.h>

        void set_driver_hook(int what, closure arg)
        void set_driver_hook(int what, string arg)
        void set_driver_hook(int what, string *arg)

DESCRIPTION
        This privileged efun sets the driver hook 'what' (values are
        defined in <driver_hook.h>) to 'arg'.
        The exact meanings and types of 'arg' depend of the hook set.
