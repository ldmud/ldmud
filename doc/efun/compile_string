DESCRIPTION
        Compiles <str> into a closure. The closure will be bound to the
        current object. By default the string will be interpreted as an
        LPC expression. The string may also contain preprocessor directives
        (which must occur on their own line).

        The argument names are given as the first argument <args>.

        The optional argument <flag> may be a binary-OR of the following
        option values:

          CS_COMPILE_EXPRESSION
              The string is interpreted as an expression (eg. "1+1") and
              therefore must not contain a terminal semicolon. This is
              the default.

          CS_COMPILE_BLOCK
              The string is interpreted as a block (code between braces),
              the surrounding braces can be omitted. To return a value,
              the code needs a return statement.

          CS_ASYNC
              The code will be compiled as a coroutine, i.e. the resulting
              closure will return a coroutine when called.

          CS_USE_OBJECT_VARIABLES
          CS_USE_OBJECT_FUNCTIONS
          CS_USE_OBJECT_STRUCTS
              By default the code may not reference the current object's
              variables, functions resp. structs. This flag allows that,
              but successful lookups in <variables>, <functions> resp.
              <structs> have precedence. Private variables, functions
              and structs cannot be accessed this way.

        Optionally the functions accepts a mapping or closure for the lookup
        of variables, functions resp. structs. A mapping is looked up using
        the name, the closure will be called with the name as its only
        argument. The name of the variable, function resp. struct will be
        given as a symbol. The result (mapping value resp. closure return
        value) should be:
          - for <functions> a closure,
          - for <variables> a reference, and
          - for <structs> a template struct (i.e. a struct whose data are
            irrelevant, only its type will be used).

        When compiling expressions the result of the H_AUTO_INCLUDE_EXPRESSION
        driver hook will be prepended, for blocks the H_AUTO_INCLUDE_BLOCK
        hook will be used.

EXAMPLES
        funcall(compile_string(({'a,'b}), "a+b"), 1, 2);
