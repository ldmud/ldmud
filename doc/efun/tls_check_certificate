SYNOPSIS
        mixed * tls_check_certificate(object obj)
        mixed * tls_check_certificate(object obj, int extra)

DESCRIPTION
        tls_check_certificate() checks the certificate of the secured
        connection bound to <obj> (default is the current object). An
        error is thrown if <obj> is not interactive or TLS is not
        available.

        An error is also thrown if <obj> doesn't have a secure connection
        up and running.

        Otherwise, the result is an array with these values:

          int [0]   : Result code of SSL_get_verify_result (see 'man 1 verify'
                      subsection DIAGNOSTICS for possible values).
          array [1] : Array with 3*n entries of extra x509 data.
                      Structure is:
                        3*i    : numerical form of object name,
                                 e.g. "2.5.4.3"
                        3*i + 1: long or short name if available,
                                 e.g. "commonName"
                        3*i + 2: value
          array [2] : If <extra> is set:
                        array with 3*n entries of x509 extension data
                        data structure is:
                        3*i    : numerical form of extension name
                        3*i + 1: long or short name of extension
                                 name if available
                        3*i + 2: array of strings with the data
                                 structure of [1]

        Note: An X509 certificate can have more than one object with
        the same name.

HISTORY
        Introduced in LDMud 3.3.672/3.2.11.
        LDMud 3.3.711/3.2.12 modified the behaviour to return the low-level
        API result value, and to throw an error if the connection is not
        secure.
