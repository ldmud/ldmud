DESCRIPTION
        Gather some driver internal debug information according
        to the setting of flag:

        DINFO_OBJECT (0): Information like heart_beat, enable_commands
            etc. of the specified object will be printed, and 0 returned.

        DINFO_MEMORY (1): Memory usage information like how many strings,
            variables, inherited files, object size etc. will be printed
            about the specified object, and 0 returned.

        DINFO_OBJLIST (2): Objects from the global object list are
            returned.  If the optional second arg is omitted, the first
            element (numbered 0) is returned. If the second arg is a
            number n, the n'th element of the object list returned. If the
            second arg is an object, it's successor in the object list is
            returned.

        DINFO_MALLOC (3): Equivalent to typing ``malloc'' at the command
            line. No second arg must be given. Returns 0.

        DINFO_STATUS (4): Collect the status information of the driver.
            The optional second arg can be 0, "tables", "swap", "malloc"
            or any other argument accepted by the actual driver.
            The result is a printable string with the status information,
            or 0 if an invalid argument was given.

        DINFO_DUMP (5): Dump the information specified by <arg2> into the
            filename specified by <arg3>. If <arg3> is omitted, a default
            file name is used. The function calls master->valid_write() to
            check that it can write the files. The file in question is
            always written anew.

            Result is 1 on success, or 0 if an error occured.

            <arg2> == "objects": dump information about all live objects.
              Default filename is '/OBJ_DUMP', the valid_write() will read
              'objdump' for the function.

              For every object, a line is written into the file with the
              following information in the given order:
                - object name
                - size in memory, shared data counted only once
                - size in memory if data wouldn't be shared
                - number of references
                - 'HB' if the object has a heartbeat, nothing if not.
                - the name of the environment, or '--' if the object has no
                  environment
                - in parentheses the number of execution ticks spent in this
                  object
                - the swap status:
                   nothing if not swapped,
                   'PROG SWAPPED' if only the program is swapped
                   'VAR SWAPPED' if only the variabes are swapped
                   'SWAPPED' if both program and variables are swapped

             <arg2> == "destructed": dump information about all destructed
               objects.  Default filename is '/DEST_OBJ_DUMP', the
               valid_write() will read 'objdump' for the function.

              For every object, a line is written into the file with the
              following information in the given order:
                - object name
                - number of references
                - 'NEW' if the object was destructed in this executiong
                  thread, nothing if it is older already.

            <arg2> == "opcodes": dump usage information about the opcodes.
              Default filename is '/OPC_DUMP', the valid_write() will read
              'opcdump' for the function.



        DINFO_DATA (6): Return raw information about an aspect of
            the driver specified by <arg2>. The result of the function
            is an array with the information, or 0 for unsupported values
            of <arg2>.
            
            If <arg3> is given and in the range of array indices
            for the given <arg2>, the result will be just the indexed array
            entry, but not the full array.

            Allowed values for <arg2> are: DID_STATUS, DID_SWAP, DID_MALLOC.

            <arg2> == DID_STATUS (0): Returns the "status" and "status tables"

               If the array has more than one entries, the first entry is 0 or
               the name of the object with the heartbeat which started the
               current thread; all following entries describe the call stack
               starting with the topmost function called.

               All call entries are arrays themselves with the following
               elements:

               int[TRACE_TYPE]: The type of the call frame:
                   TRACE_TYPE_SYMBOL (0): a function symbol (shouldn't happen).
                   TRACE_TYPE_SEFUN  (1): a simul-efun.
                   TRACE_TYPE_EFUN   (2): an efun closure.
                   TRACE_TYPE_LAMBDA (3): a lambda closure.
                   TRACE_TYPE_LFUN   (4): a normal lfun.

               mixed[TRACE_NAME]: The 'name' of the called frame:
                   _TYPE_EFUN:   either the name of the efun, or the code of
                                 the instruction for operator closures
                   _TYPE_LAMBDA: the numeric lambda identifier.
                   _TYPE_LFUN:   the name of the lfun.

               string[TRACE_PROGRAM]: The (file)name of the program holding the
                   code.
               string[TRACE_OBJECT]:  The name of the object for which the code
                                      was executed.
               int[TRACE_LOC]:
                   _TYPE_LAMBDA: current program offset from the start of the
                                 closure code.
                   _TYPE_LFUN:   the line number.

            <arg2> == DIT_STR_CURRENT (2): Return the information about the
               current call trace as printable string.

HISTORY
        Since 3.2.7, DINFO_STATUS returns the status information instead
          of printing it.
        DINFO_DUMP introduced with 3.2.7.
        LDMud 3.2.8 added the data size of the object to the result of
          DINFO_MEMORY; the DINFO_DATA request; the DID_MEM_WASTED* stats.
        LDMud 3.2.9 added DINFO_TRACE; the indexing feature for DINFO_DATA;
          the 'destructed' DINFO_DUMP; the DID_MEM_CLIB*, DID_MEM_PERM*,
          DID_ST_OBJECTS_NEWLY_DEST, DID_ST_OBJECTS_DEST, DID_MEM_OVERHEAD,
          DID_MEM_ALLOCATED, DID_MEM_USED, DID_MEM_TOTAL_UNUSED, and
          DID_ST_HBEAT_CALLS_TOTAL stats.
        LDMud 3.3 replaced the string related DID_ST_ constants according to
        the new string implementation.
