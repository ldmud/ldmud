SYNOPSIS
        int baseof(struct b, struct s)

DESCRIPTION
        Test if the type of struct <b> is a base of struct <s> (the
        values of <b> and <s> are irrelevant). Results are:
          0: <b> is not a base of <s>, nor is <b> of equal type as <s>
               (though <s> might be a base of <b>).
          1: <b> is a true base of <s>
          2: <b> and <s> are the same struct type

HISTORY
