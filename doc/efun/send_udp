SYNOPSIS
	int send_udp(string host, int port, string message)
	int send_udp(string host, int port, int * message)

DESCRIPTION
	Sends The message in an UDP packet to the given host and port
	number.

        The efun causes the privilege violation ("send_udp").

	Returns 1 on success, 0 on failure.

        Note: On some machines a failed send_udp() will not be registered
        until the next send_udp() - the latter one might return '0' even
        if itself was successful.

HISTORY
        LDMud 3.2.9 renamed this efun from send_imp(), and also changed the
          privilege violation string and the apply names.
