PRELIMINARY
SYNOPSIS
        int tls_available()

DESCRIPTION
        If the global TLS initialisation could not be set up,
        tls_is_available() returns 0, otherwise 1.

        It is not very useful to call any other tls_*-efun if this one
        returns 0, since there is no TLS-encryption available.

        Most likely the global initialisation failed due to a missing or
        unreadable key resp. certificate-file.

HISTORY
        Introduced in LDMud 3.3.474 and later backported to 3.2.11.
