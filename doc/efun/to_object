SYNOPSIS
        object to_object(string arg)
        object to_object(closure arg)
        object to_object(object arg)

        (object)<value>

DESCRIPTION
        The argument is converted into an object, if possible.
        For strings, the object with a matching file_name() is
        returned, or 0 if there is none, as find_object() does.
        For (bound!) closures, the object holding the closure is
        returned.
        Objects and the number 0 return themselves.

SEE ALSO
        find_object(E), to_array(E), to_int(E), to_string(E)
