SYNOPSIS
        float to_float(int)
        float to_float(string)
        float to_float(float)

        (float)<value>

DESCRIPTION
        Ints are expanded to floats; strings are converted up to the
        first character that doesnt belong into a float.

        Floats are just returned.

BUGS
        The cast notation only works if the precise type of <value>
        is known at compile-time. This will not be fixed - use the
        function form instead.

SEE ALSO
        to_string(E), to_int(E), sscanf(E)
