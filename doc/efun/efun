NAME
        efun

DESCRIPTION
        This directory contains descriptions for the efuns of LDMud 3.3.

        These are functions that are supplied by the driver and can be
        called by any LPC object (somewhat similar to system calls in the
        C library).

        There a few kinds of efuns:

         - 'optional'

           A mud's maintainer is free to deactivate these efuns when
           compiling the driver:

             break_point()
             db_*()
             pg_*()
             sl_*()
             parse_command()
             process_string()
             rusage()
             transfer()
             tls_available()
             tls_check_certificate()
             tls_deinit_connection()
             tls_error()
             tls_init_connection()
             tls_query_connection_info()
             tls_query_connection_state()
             tls_refresh_certs()
             xml_generate()
             xml_parse()
             json_serialize()
             json_parse()

         - 'preliminary' or 'experimental'

           The behaviour of these efuns is not fixed yet, and may change
           with further releases:

             tls_*()
             xml_generate()
             xml_parse()

         - 'deprecated' or 'obsolete'

           These efuns should no longer be used, they are merely provided
           for backwards compatibility:

             make_shared_string()
             md5()
             sha1()
