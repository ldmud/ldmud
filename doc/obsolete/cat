REMOVED EFUN
SYNOPSIS
        int cat(string path, int start, int num)

DESCRIPTION
        List the file found at path.

        In most installations it is not legal to have '..' or spaces
        in the path. This commands is normally connected to the "cat"
        command that wizards have. It is also used by the "help"
        command. The optional arguments start and num are start line
        number and number of lines. If they are not given the whole
        file is printed from the beginning.

        The total number of lines will not exceed a system limit, which
        normally is 50 lines.

        cat() returns the number of lines read and printed if success,
        0 if no such file or no lines to read (if start or len is < 0,
        or if the file has less than start lines).

        This efun has been deprecated in 3.3.719. Please don't use it in new
        code. Use either a combination of read_bytes() + tell_object() or the
        sefun cat() from the driver package.

EXAMPLES
        cat("/doc/efun/cat", 5, 9);

        This will print out the file "/doc/efun/cat" begining at line
        5 and ending with line 13.

HISTORY
