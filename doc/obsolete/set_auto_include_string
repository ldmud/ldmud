REMOVED EFUN
SYNOPSIS
        void set_auto_include_string (string arg)

DESCRIPTION

        The arg will be automatically included into every compiled LPC
        object. This is useful to enforce global definitions, e.g.
        ``#pragma rtt_checks'' or ``#pragma strict_types''.  The
        calling object needs to be privileged by the master object.

        Note that the auto-include-string is cleared when the master
        object is reloaded.

HISTORY
        LDMud 3.2.9 replaced this efun with driver hook H_AUTO_INCLUDE.
          This old version is available if the driver is compiled
          with USE_DEPRECATED.
        Removed in LDMud 3.3.
