REMOVED EFUN
SYNOPSIS
        mapping allocate_mapping(int size, int width)

DESCRIPTION
        Reserve memory for a mapping.

        size is the number of entries (i.e. keys) to reserve, width is
        the number of data items per entry. If the optional width is
        omitted, 1 is used as default.

        This is useful only when you are going to construct a mapping
        whose approximate size you know beforehand, to save on malloc
        overhead. If you don't fill in data for all the allocated
        elements, any leftovers will be freed after the current
        function execution ended. It is also useful if you want the
        mapping to have a certain width even if you don't provide
        all the data items for the keys yet.
