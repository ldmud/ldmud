DESCRIPTION
        This directory contains descriptions of miscellaneous
        internals of Amylaar's version of the LPC parser/interpreter,
        that might be useful to know.

        One thing described here are the special hardcoded commands
        of the interpreter for querying the status of the memory
        management.
