SYNOPSIS
        int privilege_violation(string op, mixed who, mixed arg3, mixed arg4)

DESCRIPTION
        Validate the execution of a privileged operation.
        op denotes the requested operation, who is the object
        requesting the operation (file_name or object pointer), arg3
        and arg4 are additional arguments, depending on the operation.

        The function should return >0 to grant the privilege, 0 to
        indicate that the caller was probably misleaded and the error
        might be fixed, and anything else to indicate a real
        violation, that will be handled as run time error.

        The privileged operations are:
        attach_erq_demon  Attach the erq demon to object <arg> with
                          flag <args>.
        bind_lambda          Bind a lambda-closure to object arg3.
        call_out_info          Return an array with all call_out
                          informations.
        execute_command   Execute command string <arg2> for the object
                          <arg>.
        erq               A the request <arg2> is to be send to the
                          erq-demon by the object <who>.
        input_to          Object <who> redirects the next input from
                          commandgiver <arg>, using <arg2> as value
                          for the flags. This is used for flag values
                          including the 'no bang' option.
        limited:          Execute <arg> with reduced/changed limits.
        nomask simul_efun Attempt to get an efun <arg> via efun:: when
                          it is shadowed by a nomask type simul_efun.
        rename_object     The object <who> tries to rename the object
                          <arg> to the name <arg2>.
        send_udp          Send UDP-data to host <arg>.
        get_extra_wizinfo Get the additional wiz-list info for user
                          <arg>.
        set_extra_wizinfo Set the additional wiz-list info for user
                          <arg>.
        set_extra_wizinfo_size Set the size of the additional user
                          info in the wiz-list to <arg>.
        set_driver_hook   Set hook <arg> to <arg2>.
        set_limits        Set limits to <arg>.
        set_this_object   Set this_object() to <arg>.
        shadow_add_action Add an action to function <arg2> of object <arg>
                          from the shadow <who> which is shadowing <arg>.
        symbol_variable   Attempt to make a symbol from a hidden
                          inherited variable. <arg> is the object in
                          question, <arg2> the number of the variable in
                          the variable table.
        wizlist_info      Return an array with all wiz-list
                          information.

        call_out_info() can return the arguments to functions and
        lambda closures to be called by call_out(); you should
        consider that read access to closures, mappings and arrays
        means write access and/or other privileges.
        wizlist_info() will return an array which holds, among others,
        the extra wizlist field. While a toplevel array, if found,
        will be copied, this does not apply to nested arrays or to any
        mappings. You might also have some sensitive closures there.
        send_udp() should be watched as it could be abused.
        The xxx_extra_wizinfo operations are necessary for a proper
        wizlist and should therefore be restricted to admins.
        All other operations are potential sources for direct security
        breaches - any use of them should be scrutinized closely.
