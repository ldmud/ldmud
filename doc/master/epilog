SYNOPSIS
        void epilog(void)                /* compat in 3.2 */
        string *epilog(int eflag)        /* !compat or 3.2.1 */

DESCRIPTION
        Perform final actions before opening the system to users.
        The semantics of this function differ for compat and !compat
        mode, and between 3.2 and 3.2.1.

        Compat in 3.2: the objects from the INIT_FILE (#defined to
        "room/init_file" at compile time in the parser) are already
        loaded at this time. Normally there is nothing left to do for
        this function.

        !Compat and 3.2.1: the argument is the number of -e options that were
        given to the parser on the commandline. Normally it is just 0
        or 1. The function should return an array of strings, which
        traditionally denote the objects to be preloaded with
        master->preload(). Any other return value is interpreted as
        ``no object to preload''. The resulting strings will be passed
        one at a time as arguments to preload().
