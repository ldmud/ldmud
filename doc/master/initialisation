SYNOPSIS
        Initialization of the master object.

DESCRIPTION
        As the lfuns which are called to initialize
        objects after a load are defined through driver hooks, and
        these hooks are cleared prior to a master (re)load, the first
        function called is inaugurate_master(). Anyway it's not very
        sensible to do anything earlier as the master is not
        recognized as such at that time, and so a number of
        (important) things would not work.
        Which lfun is called during runtime to reset the master is also
        depending on the driverhook settings. Arbitrary actions may be done
        on a reset.
