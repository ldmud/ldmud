SYNOPSIS
        object connect(void)

DESCRIPTION
        Return a login object that the requested connection should be
        bound to. 

        Note that the connection is at this time bound to the master object,
        and will be re-bound to the returned object.

        The lfun logon() will be applied to the login object after
        binding the connection to it. That lfun has to return != 0 to
        indicate success.
