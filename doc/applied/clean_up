SYNOPSIS
        int clean_up(int refcount)

DESCRIPTION
        clean_up() is applied by the parser when an object hasn't been
        used for a long time, to give it a possibility to
        self-destruct. The refcount passed as argument will be 0 for
        clone objects, 1 for a simple loaded object, and greater when
        the object is cloned or inherited by some existing object.  It
        is recommended not to self_destruct the object when the
        reference count is greater than one.
        By convention, a refcount < 0 is used if some other object
        asks the called object to clean_up.

        If clean_up returns 0, it will not be called again in that
        object until it is swapped out and in again.

        Returning a non-zero value is only recommended when the reason
        why the object can't self-destruct is likely to vanish without
        the object being touched, that is, when no local function is
        called in it, (and in compat mode also when the object is not
        being moved around).

        A typical mud configuration defines the time to wait for
        clean_up() so long that you can assert reset() has been
        called since the object has been touched last time.

EXAMPLES
        A clone of /std/drink defines clean_up() to self-destruct if
        it is empty, not carried a living being and not touched for
        a long time.

        A room that inherits /std/room defines clean_up() to
        self-destruct if it is neither inherited nor used as a
        blueprint, is empty and was not entered for a long time.
