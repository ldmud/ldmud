SYNOPSIS
        int query_level(void)

DESCRIPTION
        In former times this function was used by the parser when
        executing set_living_name() to check if the calling object
        should be marked as being a wizard.

        Mentioned here only for hysterical raisins, not used by the
        parser anymore.
