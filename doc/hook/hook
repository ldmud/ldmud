CONCEPT
        driver hooks

DESCRIPTION
        To allow a greater flexibility of the muds, the gamedrivers
        since 3.2.1 moved several once hardcoded 'underground'
        activities from the driver into the mudlib. This includes for
        example the differences between compat and native mode.

        The hooks are set with the privileged efun set_driver_hook().
        Some of the hooks are mandatory, some not. Most hooks accept
        unbound lambda closures as values, some also lfun closures or
        even strings.
        The hooks are identified by an ordinal number, for which
        symbolic names are defined in /sys/driverhooks.h.
