Options are:
.HP
\fB\-\-args\fR <filename>
.IP
Read the options from <filename> as if they were given on the
commandline.
.HP
\fB\-P\fR|--inherit <fd-number>
.IP
Inherit filedescriptor <fd-number> from the parent process
as socket to listen for connections.
.HP
\fB\-u\fR|--udp <portnumber>
.IP
Specify the <portnumber> for the UDP port, overriding the compiled-in
default.
.HP
\fB\-D\fR|--define <macro>[=<text>]
.IP
Add <macro> (optionally to be expanded to <text>) to the list of
predefined macros known by the LPC compiler.
.HP
\fB\-E\fR|--eval-cost <ticks>
.IP
Set the number of <ticks> available for one evaluation thread.
.HP
\fB\-M\fR|--master <filename>
.IP
Use <filename> for the master object.
.HP
\fB\-m\fR|--mudlib <pathname>
.IP
Use <pathname> as the top directory of the mudlib.
.HP
\fB\-\-debug\-file\fR <filename>
.IP
Log all debug output in <filename> instead of <host>.debug.log .
.HP
\fB\-\-hostname\fR <name>
.IP
Use <name> as hostname, instead of what the system says.
.HP
\fB\-\-hostaddr\fR <addr>
.IP
Use <addr> as address of this machine, instead of what the
system says. In particular this address will be used to open
the driver ports.
.HP
\fB\-\-compat\fR
.HP
\fB\-\-no\-compat\fR
.IP
Select the mode (compat or plain) of the driver.
Note that this choice does not affect the default name of the master
object.
.HP
\fB\-d\fR|--debug
.IP
Generate debug output; repeat the argument for even more output.
.HP
\fB\-c\fR|--list-compiles
.IP
List the name of every compiled file on stderr.
.HP
\fB\-e\fR|--no-preload
.IP
Pass a non-zero argument (the number of occurences of this option)
to master->preload(), which usually inhibits all preloads of castles
and other objects.
.HP
\fB\-\-erq\fR <filename>
.HP
\fB\-\-erq\fR "<filename> <erq arguments>"
.IP
Use <filename> instead of 'erq' as the name of the ERQ executable.
If the name starts with a '/', it is take to be an absolute pathname,
otherwise it is interpreted relative to /usr/local/mud/bin.
If not specified, 'erq' is used as executable name.
With the proper use of quotes it is legal to pass arbitrary arguments
to the erq, however, these may not contain spaces themselves.
.HP
\fB\-N\fR|--no-erq
.IP
Don't start the erq demon (if it would be started at all).
.HP
\fB\-\-alarm\-time\fR <time>
.IP

.HP
\fB\-\-heart\-beat\-interval\fR <time>
.IP

.HP
\fB\-\-synchronous\-heart\-beat\fR
.IP
All heartbeats are executed at the same time (modulo granularity).
.HP
\fB\-\-asynchronous\-heart\-beat\fR
.IP
Heartbeats are executed immediately when they are due (modulo granularity).
.HP
\fB\-t\fR|--no-heart-beat
.IP
Disable heartbeats and call_outs.
.HP
\fB\-f\fR|--funcall <word>
.IP
The lfun master->flag() is called with <word> as argument before the
gamedriver accepts network connections.
.HP
\fB\-\-cleanup\-time\fR <time>
.IP
The idle time in seconds for an object before the driver tries to
clean it up. This time should be substantially higher than the
reset time. A time <= 0 disables the cleanup mechanism.
.HP
\fB\-\-reset\-time\fR <time>
.IP
The time in seconds for an object before it is reset.
A time <= 0 disables the reset mechanism.
.HP

.HP
\fB\-\-max\-mapping\fR <size>
.IP
The maximum number of elements (keys+values) a mapping can hold.
Set to 0, mappings of any size are allowed.
.HP
\fB\-\-max\-mapping\-keys\fR <size>
.IP

can handle.
Set to 0, reads and writes of any size are allowed.
.HP

can handle.
Set to 0, reads and writes of any size are allowed.
.HP
\fB\-\-max\-thread\-pending\fR <size>
.IP
The maximum number of bytes to be kept pending by the socket write
thread.
Set to 0, an unlimited amount of data can be kept pending.
(Ignored since pthreads are not supported)
.TP

| \fB\-\-swap\-time\fR <time>
.HP
\fB\-s\fR v<time> | \fB\-\-swap\-variables\fR <time>
