default.
.HP
\fB\-D\fR|\-\-define <macro>[=<text>]
.IP

predefined macros known by the LPC compiler.
.HP
\fB\-E\fR|\-\-eval\-cost <ticks>
.IP

.HP
\fB\-M\fR|\-\-master <filename>

.HP
\fB\-m\fR|\-\-mudlib <pathname>
.IP
Use <pathname> as the top directory of the mudlib.
.HP
\fB\-\-debug\-file\fR <filename>
.IP
Log all debug output in <filename> instead of <host>.debug.log .
.HP
\fB\-\-access\-file\fR <filename>|none
.IP
Activate access control with these access permissions data.
If 'none' is given access control is deactivated.

\fB\-\-access\-log\fR <filename>|none
.IP
Log valid and rejected connections into this file.
If 'none' is given no log is written.
.HP
\fB\-\-hostname\fR <name>
.IP
Use <name> as hostname, instead of what the system says.
.HP
\fB\-\-hostaddr\fR <addr>
.IP
Use <addr> as address of this machine, instead of what the
system says. In particular this address will be used to open
the driver ports.
.HP
\fB\-\-compat\fR
.HP
\fB\-\-no\-compat\fR
.IP
Select the mode (compat or plain) of the driver.
Note that this choice does not affect the default name of the master
object.
.HP
\fB\-d\fR|\-\-debug
.IP

.HP
\fB\-c\fR|\-\-list\-compiles
.IP

\fB\-\-erq\fR <filename>
.HP
\fB\-\-erq\fR "<filename> <erq arguments>"
.IP

If the name starts with a '/', it is take to be an absolute pathname,
otherwise it is interpreted relative to the executable directory.
If not specified, 'erq' is used as executable name.
With the proper use of quotes it is legal to pass arbitrary arguments
to the erq, however, these may not contain spaces themselves.
