NAME
        ed0

DESCRIPTION
        When in 'ed', the prompt is ':'.

        Ed has two modes, command mode and insert mode. The insert
        mode has no prompt. You exit the insert mode by typing a
        single '.' on a line.

        All commands have the following syntax:

        X,Ycmd

        or

        Xcmd

        For example:

        1,10p
        Will print line 1 to 10.
        1,5d
        Will delete line 1 to 5.
        8p
        Will print line 8.
        A '.' is the "current line". The current line is the last line
        referenced. If you want to print last line + 10 more:
        .,.+10p

NOTE
        These manpages seem a bit antique, though still correct. For a
        better detailed help, invoke ed and use the ``h'' command.
        Also you could look into the man page for ed(1) on you nearest
        Unix box. And for a bit of fun you can try the good old
        quiz(6), invoke as ``quiz function ed-command''.
