DESCRIPTION
        Searching is done with:
        /hello/
        Find first line in of after current line.
        Just // will repeat the search.

        The patterns are regular expressions, where some characters
        have a special meaning:
        .        Match any character.
        x*        Match any numbers of x (0 or more).
        [abc]        Match 'a', 'b' or 'c'.
        [0-9]        Match any digit 0 - 9.
        [a-z]        Match any lowercase letter.
        \x        Match 'x' where 'x' can be any character except '('
                and ')'.

EXAMPLE
        s/ab.d/ABCD/
        Substitute any string 'abXd' against 'ABCD' where X can be any
        character.

NOTE
        This only half the truth, there is lots more magic in the
        regexps.
