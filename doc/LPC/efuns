        efuns

DESCRIPTION
        Efuns are "system calls" in the LPC driver, the C program
        which compiles and executes the LPC programs of the mudlib.
        These are hardcoded functions which perform basic tasks which
        would be ineffective or impossible to be implemented in the
        mudlib.

        There are efuns for accessing the underlying filesystem, for
        creating, moving and destructing objects, for writing
        messages to users, for manipulation of LPC data types.
