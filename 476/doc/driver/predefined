NAME
    predefined - predefined #defines by the parser

DESCRIPTION
    Several preprocessor macros are pre#defined by the parser,
    to provide information about parser version, compile time
    options and parser invocation options:

      LPC3            : always defined.
      __LDMUD__       : always defined.
      __EUIDS__       : always (for compatibility).
      COMPAT_FLAG     : defined if the driver runs in compat mode.
      __COMPAT_MODE__ : ditto
      __STRICT_EUIDS__: defined if strict euid usage is enforced.

      __MASTER_OBJECT__ : the name of the master object (in compat mode
                          without leading '/').
      __FILE__          : the name of the compiled file (in compat mode
                          without leading '/').
      __LINE__          : the actual line number.
      __DIR__           : the directory path of the compiled file (in
                          compat mode without leading '/').
      __PATH__(n)       : the <n> leading directory path elements of the
                          compiled file (in compat mode without leading '/').
      __VERSION__       : the version string of the driver.
      __VERSION_MAJOR__ : the major version number of the driver.
      __VERSION_MINOR__ : the minor version number of the driver.
      __VERSION_MICRO__ : the micro version number of the driver.
      __VERSION_PATCH__ : the patchlevel of the driver; a 0 here means
                          'no patchlevel'.

      __DOMAIN_NAME__    : the domain the host is part of.
      __HOST_IP_NUMBER__ : the hosts IP number (as a string).
      __HOST_NAME__      : the full hostname.
      __MAX_RECURSION__  : the max count of nested function calls
                           (this is config.h:MAX_USER_TRACE).
      __MAX_EVAL_COST__  : the max evaluation cost.
      __CATCH_EVAL_COST__ : the min amount of eval cost which needs to
                            be available to execute a catch().
      __MASTER_EVAL_COST__: the eval cost reserve for master applies.
      __RESET_TIME__     : default interval time between object resets.
      __CLEANUP_TIME__   : default interval time between object cleanups.
      __EFUN_DEFINED__(name) : if the efun 'name' exists, this
                               macro evaluates to " 1 ", else to " 0 ".
      __DRIVER_LOG__     : the name of the default debug.log file (within
                             the mudlib); undefined if a different name
                             has been specified on the commandline.
      __WIZLIST__        : the name of the (mudlib) file from where the
                           driver read the initial WIZLIST information.
                           It is undefined if the driver was configured
                           to not read the information.
      __INT_MAX__        : the largest integer number
      __INT_MIN__        : the smallest integer number
      __FLOAT_MAX__      : the largest (positive) float number
      __FLOAT_MIN__      : the smallest (positive) float number

    If the ERQ is supported, the following macros are defined:

      __ERQ_MAX_SEND__  : the max size of the send buffer
      __ERQ_MAX_REPLY__ : the max size of the reply buffer

    The following macros are defined if their associated package
    has been compiled into the driver:
      
      __IPV6__ :      support for IP v 6
      __MYSQL__ :     support for mySQL
      __LPC_NOSAVE__: support for the 'nosave' keyword
      __DEPRECATED__: support for obsolete and deprecated efuns.
