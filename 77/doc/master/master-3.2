NAME
	master for LPMud 3.2

DESCRIPTION
	This directory contains descriptions for the functions that
	Amylaar's version of the LPC parser, expects to find in the
	master object (similar to lfuns, but for the master object
	only). The name of the master object is hardcoded in the
	parser (usually to "secure/master").

	The master is the gateway between the interpreter and the
	mudlib to perform actions with mudlib specific effects. Calls
	to the master by the interpreter have an automatic catch() in
	effect.

	Note that the master is loaded first of all objects. Thus you
	shouldn't inherit an other object, nor is the compiler able to
	search include files (read: they must be specified with full
	path).

	Amylaar says: actually, you can inherit, but the file will be
	loaded then before the master, which isn't good for most
	files.

	A short survey of the things that happen at system startup
	time:

	The Initialisation functions are called after (re)loading the
	master to establish the most basic operation parameters.

	The initialisation of LPMud on startup follows this schedule:
	  - The interpreter evaluates the commandline options and
	    initializes itself.
	  - The master is loaded, and thus it's create() (!compat only) and
	    its reset() is called, though it's not much use, since
	    most of the important things won't work already.
	  - get_root_uid() is called. If the result is valid, it
	    becomes the masters uid and euid.
	  - get_bb_uid() is called.
	  - inaugurate_master() is called.
	  - flag() is called for each given '-f' commandline option.
	  - get_simul_efun() is called.
	  - define_include_dirs() is called.
	  - Preloading is done:
	      compat : The filenames of the objects are read from
		       INIT_FILE and the objects are loaded. Then
		       epilog() is called.
	      !compat: epilog() is called. If it returns an array of
		       strings, it is considered holding the filenames
		       of the objects to preload. They are then given
		       one at a time as argument to preload() which
		       does the actual preloading.
	  - The interpreter sets up the IP communication and enters
	    the backend loop.

	If the master is reloaded during system operation, this
	actions are taken:
	  - The master is loaded, and thus it's create() (!compat only) and
	    its reset() is called.
	  - Any auto-include string is cleared.
	  - get_root_uid() is called. If the result is valid, it becomes the
	    masters uid and euid.
	  - inaugurate_master() is called.

	If the master was destructed, but couldn't be reloaded, the old
	master object could be reactivated. In that case:
	  - reactivate_destructed_master() is called.
	  - inaugurate_master() is called.


	Security hint: most of this functions are not useful to be
	called directly from other objects and can be made private or
	static. Unlike create(), these functions that are applied to
	the master object are found by the interpreter even if not
	publicly accessible.
