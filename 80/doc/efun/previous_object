SYNOPSIS
	object previous_object()
	object previous_object(int i)

DESCRIPTION
	Returns an object pointer to the object that did a
	call_other() to the current object, if any. There are two
	exceptions for previous_object().  When the object calls a own
	function with a call_other() the previous_object() will be
	unchanged and when a destructed object calls a function of the
	current object previous_object() will return 0.

	If the optional arg is given, the call_other()s are followed
	back i times (i.e. previous_object(2) returns the caller of
	the caller). 0 <= i <= caller_stack_depth()-1

	There is an important special case: in functions called by
        the gamedriver in reaction to some external event (e.g. commands
        added by add_action), previous_object() will return this_object(),
        but previous_object(0) will return 0.

EXAMPLE
	int security() {
	   object prev;
	   if(!(prev=previous_object()));
	   else if(getuid(prev)!=getuid(this_object()));
	   else if(geteuid(prev)!=geteuid(this_object()));
	   else return 1;
	   return 0;
	}
	void high_sensible_func() {
	   if(!security())
	      return;
	   ...
	}
	
	This example shows how we can check if the last call to a
	function of the current object is secure or if we should abort
	execution.
