SYNOPSIS
        string regreplace( string txt, string pattern
                         , closure|string replacepattern, int flags)

DESCRIPTION
        This function looks through txt looking for the regular
        expression pattern. If it finds it, it replaces it by the
        replacepattern.

        The replacepattern can be a constant string, or a closure taking
        the matched substring and the position at which it was found
        as arguments and returning the replacement pattern string.
        
        The flag is a bitmask, where bit 0 specifies
        that the search and replace should repeat as often as the
        pattern matches, and bit 1 (mask 2) specifies if the regular
        expressions are 'ex' compatible or not. The function returns
        the modified string (or the original if it wasn't modified).

        The function behaves like the s/pattern/replacepattern/flags
        in editors as ed/vi or sed. The power of this function lies in
        replacing variable strings (as opposed to regexplode, where
        you can explode by regular expression, but not implode...)

EXAMPLE
        string msgin;

        /* Checks msgin for the string 'tells you: ' and all following
         * characters and encloses those characters by <underline>
         * and </underline>. global.
         */
        msgin = regreplace(msgin, "tells you: (.*)",
                 "tells you: <underline>\\1</underline>", 1);
        
        /* replaces all <underline> html tags by the vt100 escape
         * sequence for underline.
         */
        txt = regreplace(txt, "<underline>", "<ESC>[5m", 1);

        /* Put the word HOUSE into lower case. */
        txt = regreplace(txt, "HOUSE", #'lower_case, 1);
