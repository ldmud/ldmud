   Oct-92 [lars]
    dr312j ported to Amiga using DICE 2.06.

   Dec-92 [lars]
    dr312k ported to Amiga using DICE 2.06.

   Jan-92 [lars]
    Merged Deepthought's TCP-code into the beta-l-driver.

   Feb-92 [lars]
    Added a minimal getrusage() to support some wiztools.
    Some reorganisation for easier compilation for OS 1.3
    Switched from DICE 2.06 to DICE 2.07.

09-Apr-93 [lars]
    Started this log (didn't thought that I'd need it :-)
    Merged in patch @31.
    Made signal handling (esp. of Ctrl-C) more reliable. This also
     fixed a bug left over from the DICE update.
    Added provision for DICE' ffp-instead-of-float math to patchfloat.h
    Replaced the original (Oberon written) PlayMud by its C version.
     This also cut off the PlayMud/ tree and removed the last binary
     from the source archive.

03-May-93 [lars]
    Merged in PlayMud.c patches by John Fehr <umfehr06@ccu.UManitoba.CA>.
      Also fixed some problems around PlayMud and its Makefile entry.

04-Jun-93 [lars]
    BSD'ed the error codes in socket_sim.h

18-Jun-93 [lars]
    Created an own machine.h.
    Renamed config.h-Amiga and Makefile-Amiga into config.h resp. Makefile.
    Added support for AmiTCP.

16-Aug-93 [lars]
    Upgraded TCP support to AmiTCP-2.0 .
    Cleaned out some Unixisms from the Makefile.

08-Sep-93 [lars]
    Upgraded PlayMud to version 1.5.

04-Oct-93 [lars]
    Upgraded PlayMud to version 1.6.

15-Nov-93 [lars]
    Upgraded PlayMud to version 1.7.

06-Jan-94 [lars]
    sim_socket() didn't care if a socket had no to_client, thus causing
      Enforcerhits by deref'ing a NULL pointer.

11-Jan-94 [lars]
    Fixed a small but lethal bug in PlayMud.

06-Feb-94..11-Feb-94 [lars]
    Included support for SAS/C.

13-Feb-94 [lars]
    PlayMud now properly ignores IAC GA ("Make my day!").

25-Feb-94 [lars]
    PlayMud did still do synchronous writes to the console. Changed that.

05-Jun-94 [lars]
    cleanup_alarm() added to signal.c, else the messageport of the
      alarm timer wouldn't be deallocated, thus causing a tasksignal loss.
    68040 machines crash using the single precision libraries up to OS 3.0,
      so all 'floats' are now compiled as 'double's.

25-Jul-94..04-Aug-94 [lars]
    Upgraded to DICE 3.0

31-Aug-94 [lars]
    Wrote DMakefile for DICE' dmake.

25-Sep-94 [lars]
    Migrated port 3.2.1@60 from 3.2@301.

19-Nov-94 [lars]
    PlayMud now closes its read socket faster on shutdown, preventing
    lockups on abortions.

11-Apr-95 [lars]
    Merged in newest SAS diffs from Suamor.

11-Aug-95 [lars]
    nsignal.h, signal.c: Resolved __sigfunc-definition conflict between
      DICE and SAS/C by replacing all useages by a properly defined SIGFUNC.
    amiga.c: Added check for enough stack on startup.

18-Aug-95 [lars]
    Some more changes for SAS/C:
    nsignal.h: sigfunc-typedef now for all versions.
    amiga.c: Added stub for fcntl().
    socket_tcp.c: For AmiTCP >= 3, the existance of bsdsocket.library
      is checked manually.
    port.c: rusage() and struct time emulation no longer needed.
    config.h: Added check that SAS/C 6.55 or better is used.

20-Aug-95 [lars]
    socket_tcp.c: SAS/C: the netlib autoinit function is removed from the
      list of autofunctions on startup as it would exit if AmiTCP is not
      available.
    socket_tcp.h: SAS/C: Includes pragmas for AmiTCP.

01-Nov-95 [lars]
    amiga.c: DICE: added a dup() simulation to enable main.c to gobble
      up filedescriptors. The fds returned by dup() can't be used, though.
    config.h-compat: new.

06-Nov-95 [lars]
    main.c: disables auto-start of erq demon in any case.
    config.h, -compat: ERQ_DEMON defined, making efuns send_erq() and
      attach_erq_demon() available.

09-Nov-95 [lars]
    INSTALL: rewritten, added direct hints for various mudlibs.

11-Nov-95 [lars]
    socket{,_tcp,_sim}.c: amiga_sockinit/exit() now dispatches to
      amiga_tcpinit/exit() resp. amiga_siminit/exit().
    amiga.c: amiga_sockinit/exit() are now always called.
    Together this avoids a dangling simulated UDP socket if the driver
      is aborted before initialising ipc.

01-May-96 [lars]
    Upgraded PlayMud to version 1.9.
    Made check of SAS/C __VERSION__ and __REVISION__ in config.h more
      reliable.
    amiga.c: The parameters for DICE' dynamic stack routines are derived
      from the actual stacksize.

09-Jul-96  [lars]
    Upgraded for DICE 3.2 (no big deal).

28-Sep-94..05-Nov-97 [lars]
    Merged in patches for @60..@139.
    3.2.1@139 is also the last release I am going to adapt/compile for
    Amiga.
