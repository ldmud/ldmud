SYNOPSIS        varargs int difference(mixed a,mixed b,int max,                               closure element_difference);          a, b              strings or arrays of mixed          max                     (optional, defaults to MAX_INT)              the maximal number of differences on which to abort          element_difference      (optional, defaults to !(x == y) )              closure receiving two elements of a and b and returning              an int which states the difference between the two              elementsDESCRIPTION        The function returns the number of differences between the two        given values a and b.  As a difference counts one of the        following:        - a different element              (e.g. "blah", "bloh")        - a missing element                (e.g. "blah", "blh")        - an extra element                 (e.g. "blah", "blaah")        - two swapped consecutive elements (e.g. "blah", "balh")        The optional third argument (max) states a maximal number of        differences up to which the algorithm shall search for the        solution; if the result would be greater than this given number        the search will be aborted and this value (max) is returned.        The optional fourth argument (element_difference) is a closure        which returns a difference for two single elements of a and b;        if defaults to 0 for equal and 1 for different elements; thus        it is possible to react nifty on typos by giving two chars which        are close together on a keyboard a smaller difference value than        two chars which are far apart.EXAMPLE        difference("bla","bla")          /* returns 0 */        difference("bla","blo")          /* returns 1 (one different character) */        difference(({ 0,1,2,3 }),({ 0,1,3,7 }))          /* returns 2 (one pair swapped and one element wrong) */        difference("abcdefgh","stuvwxyz",5)          /* returns 5 (8 differences, but max is given as 5) */        difference(({ "abc","def","dext","jkl" }),                   ({ "abc","dext","def","jkl" }),                   100,                   (#'difference));          /* returns 1 (one word pair swapped is the least difference             while the comparison of "def" and "dext" would result 2             differences (one char different and one char missing), but             just the smallest possible amount of differences is returned             as result) */
