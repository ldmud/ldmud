/*---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Types and Macros used to describe and store compiled programs.
 *
 *---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Basics
 * ------
 *
 * LPMud distinguished between objects and their programs. Objects hold
 * the live data which is unique to each of them. Programs otoh are shared
 * among objects through inheritance or cloning and hold the program code,
 * variable specification and similar information. Due to the separation
 * programs maintain their own reference count, and it is this separation
 * which allows the separate swapping of programs and variables.
 *
 * A compiled program consists of several data blocks which are allocated
 * together in one memory block. Not only this is advantageous for the
 * memory locality, but also simplifies swapping as all data for a program
 * can be read or written in one go, with a simple relocation computation
 * on the pointers involved.
 *
 * The blocks of a program in correct allocation order are these:
 *
 *   struct program_s: The basic structure of the program, with pointers to
 *       the other data blocks.
 *
 *   bytecode program[]: the actual bytecode for the program.
 *
 *   unsigned short function_names[]: Lookup table of function name index
 *       to the offset of the function within the functions[] table.
 *       function_names[] is allocated together with and right after the
 *       bytecode. If a function redefines an inherited function, this table
 *       points to the redefinition.
 *       Read 'function_name' as 'function_index'.
 *
 *   uint32 functions[]: One word for each function, giving the type
 *       and the offset within the program[] codearray. Additional information
 *       for each function is embedded into the program code.
 *       If a program uses undefined functions, the compiler generates
 *       dummy functions.
 *       Through inheritance and cross-definition these functions can
 *       be resolved on a higher level.
 *
 *   function_t function_headers[]: Contains the function header information
 *       for each function in the bytecode. The bytecode contains the
 *       index into this table.
 *
 *   string_t *strings[]: An array of pointers to the string literals (stored
 *       as shared strings) used by the program. This way the program can
 *       use the strings simply by an (easily swappable) index. The compiler
 *       makes sure that each string is unique.
 *
 *       When a program is swapped, the reference counts to these strings are
 *       not removed so that the string literals stay in memory all the time.
 *       This saves time on swap-in, and the string sharing saves more memory
 *       than swapping might gain.
 * TODO: Does it?
 *
 *   struct variable_s variables[]: an array describing all variables
 *       with type and name, inherited or own. When a program is swapped, the
 *       reference counts to these strings are not removed so that the
 *       string literals stay in memory all the time.
 *
 *   struct inherit inherit[]: an array describing all inherited programs.
 *
 *   lpctype_t* argument_types[]: (only with #pragma save_types)
 *       The types of all function arguments of the program in the
 *       order they were encountered.
 *
 *   unsigned short type_start[]: (only with #pragma save_types)
 *       Lookup table [.num_function_names] function index
 *       -> index in .argument_types[], which gives the index of
 *       the first argument type. If this index is INDEX_START_NONE,
 *       the function has no type information.
 *
 *   unsigned short *update_index_map[]:
 *      Lookup table:
 *          old function index -> new function index
 *      and
 *          old variable index -> new variable index
 *      for obsoleted virtually inherited programs. When an older
 *      and newer program of the same name are inherited virtually,
 *      the compiler builds such a table to map the function and
 *      variable indices of the older program to the indices
 *      in the newer program.
 *
 *   include_t includes[]: an array listing all include files used
 *       to compile the program, in the order they were encountered.
 *       When a program is swapped, the reference counts to these strings
 *       are not removed so that the string literals stay in memory all
 *       the time.
 *
 * The linenumber information is allocated separately from the main program
 * block so that it can be swapped separately more easily. The struct
 * linenumbers_s is allocated to size and holds the line number information
 * as an array of bytecodes:
 *
 *   bytecode_t line_numbers[]: the line number information,
 *       encoded in a kind of delta compression. When a program
 *       is swapped in, the line numbers are allocated separately
 *       and not swapped in until needed.
 *
 * TODO: If the program_s is allocated separately from the rest,
 * TODO:: we could swap even if a program is used by clones.
 *
 *
 * Bytecode
 * --------
 *
 * The bytecode is described and defined in bytecode.h .
 *
 *
 * Inheritance
 * -----------
 *
 * Inheritance is handled such that all the variable and function
 * information of the inherited programs are appended to the programs
 * own variables and functions. The inherit entries then give away
 * where in the programs tables the inherited information can be found.
 *
 * Imagine: A and B inherit nothing, C inherits A, D inherits C and B.
 * Then the function and variable blocks are set up like this ('-funs' are
 * real function entries, '-desc' are pointers to inherit descriptors):
 *
 *     A-fblock: A-funs  (B similar)
 *     A-vblock: A-vars  (B similar)
 *
 *     C-fblock: A-desc C-funs
 *     C-vblock: A-vars C-vars
 *
 *     D-fblock: (A-desc C-desc) B-desc D-funs
 *     D-vblock:  A-vars C-vars  B-vars D-vars
 *       and fblock has the twist that (C-desc A-desc) together are
 *       considered being 'the' C-desc block.
 *
 * If a program is inherited virtually several times, each virtual inherit
 * gets its own struct inherit; the variable block however is reserved
 * just once. To mark the virtual inherit, the variable types receive the
 * modifier TYPE_MOD_VIRTUAL. During the inheritance of the compiler, functions
 * from non-virtual inherits temporarily receive the flag
 * NON_VIRTUAL_OFFSET_TAG in their variable indices, too.
 *
 * However, accesses to virtually inherited variables only use the first
 * inherit instance - if the variable index in the child's program code indexes
 * the variable block associated with a later instance, the driver finds
 * the first instance by comparing the .prog entries and uses the 'real'
 * variable associated with this first instance.
 *
 * The compiler places virtual variables always at the begin of the variable
 * block and limits the number to 256.
 *
 * When different versions of the same program (different program_t objects
 * that have the same name) are inherited only variables for the newest version
 * are used. For the old program there will actually be created two inherit
 * entrys, one describing the new program (with the corresponding function
 * and variable index offsets) and one describing the old program. The later
 * gets the INHERIT_TYPE_MAPPED flag and a table mapping old variable indices
 * to indices in the new program. The function index offset in the old inherit
 * entry will still point to the function table for the old inherit, since
 * it can't be replaced, because intermediate programs might reference,
 * cross-define or overload these functions. Therefore the function table for
 * the newer program is added and the same functions between both programs
 * are cross-defined.
 *
 * TODO: Find a way to avoid the virtual var searching - either by encoding the
 * TODO:: inherit index in the code, or by adding a ref to the 'first
 * TODO:: instance' to this structure. See interpret.c:find_virtual_value().
 *
 * Old Comments:
 * -------------
 * When an object is compiled with type testing (#pragma strict_types), all
 * types are saved of the arguments for that function during compilation.
 * If the #pragma save_types is specified, then the types are saved even
 * after compilation, to be used when the object is inherited.
