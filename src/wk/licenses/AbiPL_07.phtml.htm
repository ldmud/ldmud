<UL>





    <B>2.1. The Initial Developer Grant.</B>





    <BR>The Initial Developer hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free,


    non-exclusive license, subject to third party intellectual property


    claims: 





	<UL>





	<P><B>(a)</B> to use, reproduce, modify, display, perform, sublicense


	and distribute the Original Code (or portions thereof) with or


	without Modifications, or as part of a Larger Work; and





        <P><B>(b)</B> under patents now or hereafter owned or controlled by


        Initial Developer, to make, have made, use and sell (``Utilize'') the


        Original Code (or portions thereof), but solely to the extent that


        any such patent is reasonably necessary to enable You to Utilize the


        Original Code (or portions thereof) and not to any greater extent


        that may be necessary to Utilize further Modifications or


        combinations.


    </UL>





    <P><B>2.2. Contributor Grant.</B>





    <BR>Each Contributor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free,


    non-exclusive license, subject to third party intellectual property


    claims: 





    <UL>





    <P><B>(a)</B> to use, reproduce, modify, display, perform, sublicense and


    distribute the Modifications created by such Contributor (or portions

    Covered Code or as part of a Larger Work; and





    <P><B>(b)</B> under patents now or hereafter owned or controlled by


    Contributor, to Utilize the Contributor Version (or portions thereof),


    but solely to the extent that any such patent is reasonably necessary to


    enable You to Utilize the Contributor Version (or portions thereof), and


    not to any greater extent that may be necessary to Utilize further


    Modifications or combinations.





    </UL>





</UL>


<B>3. Distribution Obligations.</B>


<UL>





    <B>3.1. Application of License.</B>





    <BR>The Modifications which You create or to which You contribute are


    governed by the terms of this License, including without limitation


    Section <B>2.2</B>.  The Source Code version of Covered Code may be


    distributed only under the terms of this License or a future version of


    this License released under Section <B>6.1</B>, and You must include a


    copy of this License with every copy of the Source Code You


    distribute. You may not offer or impose any terms on any Source Code


    version that alters or restricts the applicable version of this License


    or the recipients' rights hereunder. However, You may include an


    additional document offering the additional rights described in Section


    <B>3.5</B>.





    <P><B>3.2. Availability of Source Code.</B>





    <BR>Any Modification which You create or to which You contribute must be


    made available in Source Code form under the terms of this License either


    on the same media as an Executable version or via an accepted Electronic


    Distribution Mechanism to anyone to whom you made an Executable version


    available; and if made available via Electronic Distribution Mechanism,


    must remain available for at least twelve (12) months after the date it


    initially became available, or at least six (6) months after a subsequent


    version of that particular Modification has been made available to such


    recipients. You are responsible for ensuring that the Source Code version


    remains available even if the Electronic Distribution Mechanism is


    maintained by a third party.





    <P><B>3.3. Description of Modifications.</B>





    <BR>You must cause all Covered Code to which you contribute to contain a


    file documenting the changes You made to create that Covered Code and the


    date of any change. You must include a prominent statement that the


    Modification is derived, directly or indirectly, from Original Code


    provided by the Initial Developer and including the name of the Initial


    Developer in (a) the Source Code, and (b) in any notice in an Executable


    version or related documentation in which You describe the origin or


    ownership of the Covered Code.





    <P><B>3.4. Intellectual Property Matters</B>


    <UL>





	<P><B>(a) Third Party Claims</B>. 





	<BR>If You have knowledge that a party claims an intellectual


	property right in particular functionality or code (or its


	utilization under this License), you must include a text file with


	the source code distribution titled ``LEGAL'' which describes the


	claim and the party making the claim in sufficient detail that a


	recipient will know whom to contact. If you obtain such knowledge


	after You make Your Modification available as described in Section


	<B>3.2</B>, You shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies


	You make available thereafter and shall take other steps (such as


	notifying appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably


	calculated to inform those who received the Covered Code that new


	knowledge has been obtained.





	<P><B>(b) Contributor APIs</B>. 





	<BR>If Your Modification is an application programming interface and


	You own or control patents which are reasonably necessary to


	implement that API, you must also include this information in the


	LEGAL file.





    </UL>





    <P><B>3.5. Required Notices.</B>





    <BR>You must duplicate the notice in <B>Exhibit A</B> in each file of the


    Source Code, and this License in any documentation for the Source Code,


    where You describe recipients' rights relating to Covered Code. If You


    created one or more Modification(s), You may add your name as a


    Contributor to the notice described in <B>Exhibit A</B>. If it is not


    possible to put such notice in a particular Source Code file due to its


    structure, then you must include such notice in a location (such as a


    relevant directory file) where a user would be likely to look for such a


    notice.  You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty,


    support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of


    Covered Code. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on


    behalf of the Initial Developer or any Contributor.  You must make it


    absolutely clear than any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability


    obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the


    Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the


    Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,


    indemnity or liability terms You offer.





    <P><B>3.6. Distribution of Executable Versions.</B>





    <BR>You may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if the


    requirements of Section <B>3.1-3.5</B> have been met for that Covered


    Code, and if You include a notice stating that the Source Code version of


    the Covered Code is available under the terms of this License, including


    a description of how and where You have fulfilled the obligations of


    Section <B>3.2</B>.  The notice must be conspicuously included in any


    notice in an Executable version, related documentation or collateral in


    which You describe recipients' rights relating to the Covered Code. You


    may distribute the Executable version of Covered Code under a license of


    Your choice, which may contain terms different from this License,


    provided that You are in compliance with the terms of this License and


    that the license for the Executable version does not attempt to limit or


    alter the recipient's rights in the Source Code version from the rights


    set forth in this License. If You distribute the Executable version under


    a different license You must make it absolutely clear that any terms


    which differ from this License are offered by You alone, not by the


    Initial Developer or any Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the


    Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the


    Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such terms You


    offer.





    <P><B>3.7. Larger Works.</B>





    <BR>You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with <font color=red>Uncovered Code</font><strike> other 


    code not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger


    Work as a single product</strike>. In such a case, You must make sure the


    requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Code.





<font color=red>


    In addition, You may distribute the Larger Work in executable form under 


    terms of Your choice, provided that You also meet all of the following 


    conditions:





    <UL>





    <P><B>(a) Use of Covered Code</B>.





    <br>You must distribute any and all Covered Code used in the Larger Work 


    in the form of a Library or Libraries under the terms of this License.  If 


    You opt to use any otherwise Uncovered Code in such a Library, then You 


    must cause the requirements of Section 3.6 to also apply to that code.  In 


    effect, any otherwise Uncovered Code in the Library is thus considered a 


    Modification for the purposes of this distribution. 





    <P><B>(b) Completeness of Library</B>.


    


    <br>If a facility in any such Library You create as part of the Larger Work refers to a function or 


    a table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses the 


    facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility is invoked, 


    then You must make a good faith effort to ensure that, in the event an 


    application does not supply such function or table, the facility still 


    operates, and performs whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful. 


    (For example, a function in a Library to compute square roots has a 


    purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the application. 


    Therefore, Subsection 3.7.b requires that any application-supplied 


    function or table used by this function must be optional: if the 


    application does not supply it, the square root function must still 


    compute square roots.) 





    <P><B>(c) Availability of Object Code</B>.





    <br>All remaining Uncovered Code in the Larger Work must be made 


    available in source and/or object code form (the "Relinkable Form"), so 


    that the user can modify any Library containing Covered Code and then 


    relink to produce a modified executable form of the Larger Work 


    containing the modified Library.  (It is understood that the user who 


    changes the contents of definitions files in the Library will not 


    necessarily be able to recompile the application to use the modified 


    definitions.) 





    <p>You must include a text file with the distribution of the Relinkable 


    Form titled ``RELINK'' which lists the exact steps which need to be 


    taken so that a developer of ordinary skill can reproduce the Larger Work 


    from the Relinkable Form using only freely- or commercially-available 


    third-party tools.  You must also ensure that this file contains a 


    complete enumeration of the specific versions of all such tools required.





    <p>You must make the Relinkable Form of the Larger Work available under 


    the terms of this License either 


    on the same media as an Executable version or via an accepted Electronic


    Distribution Mechanism to anyone to whom you made an Executable version


    available; and if made available via Electronic Distribution Mechanism,


    must remain available for at least twelve (12) months after the date it


    initially became available, or at least six (6) months after a subsequent


    version of the Larger Work has been made available to such


    recipients. You are responsible for ensuring that the Relinkable Form


    remains available even if the Electronic Distribution Mechanism is


    maintained by a third party.





    </UL>

</UL>


<B>4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation.</B>


<UL>





<font color=red>


    <p>If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of 


    Section 3.7 of this License due to statute or regulation then You must 


    not distribute the Larger Work at all.  In such a case, You may opt to 


    release Your entire work under the terms of Section 3.6 instead, provided 


    that You have sufficient rights to the Uncovered Code to do so.  


</font>





    <P>If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the <font color=red>other</font> terms of this


    License with respect to some or all of the Covered Code due to statute or


    regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License to


    the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the


    code they affect. Such description must be included in the LEGAL file


    described in Section <B>3.4</B> and must be included with all


    distributions of the Source Code. Except to the extent prohibited by


    statute or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for


    a recipient of ordinary skill


    to be able to understand it.





</UL>


<B>5. Application of this License.</B>


<UL>





    This License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has attached


    the notice in <B>Exhibit A</B>, and to related Covered Code.





</UL>


<font color=red>


<B>##. Trademarks.</B>


<UL>





    Note that this License only addresses the restrictions under which 


    certain copyright rights are granted.  It does not grant You any rights 


    to use any trademarks held by the Initial Developer or any Contributor.  


    Such rights may be granted to You under another license, which may have 


    been provided to You along with the Covered Code, such as, for example, 


    the AbiSource Trademark License.





    <p>Code covered by this License may have been distributed to You with 


    unlicensed usage of trademarks held by some party.  If this is the case,


    this does not constitute a grant to You of the right to use such


    trademarks.  Compliance with trademark restrictions remains Your


    obligation, and this License does not affect that obligation, especially 


    if You redistribute Covered Code.





    <p>If You have knowledge that a party claims a trademark right in 


    particular functionality or code (or its


    utilization under this License), You must include a text file with


    the source code distribution titled ``TRADEMARK'' which describes the


    claim and the party making the claim in sufficient detail that a


    recipient will know whom to contact. If You obtain such knowledge


    after You make Your Modification available as described in Section


    <B>3.2</B>, You shall promptly modify the TRADEMARK file in all copies


    You make available thereafter and shall take other steps (such as


    notifying appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably


    calculated to inform those who received the Covered Code that new


    knowledge has been obtained.





</UL>


</font>


<B>6. Versions of the License.</B>


<UL>





    <B>6.1. New Versions</B>. 





    <BR><font color=red>AbiSource, Inc. (``AbiSource'')</font> may publish


    revised and/or new versions of the License from time to time.  Each


    version will be given a distinguishing version number.





    <P><B>6.2. Effect of New Versions</B>. 





    <BR>Once Covered Code has been published under a particular version of


    the License, You may always continue to use it under the terms of that


    version. You may also choose to use such Covered Code under the terms of


    any subsequent version of the License published by <font color=red>AbiSource</font>. No one other


    than <font color=red>AbiSource</font> has the right to modify the terms applicable to Covered


    Code created under this License.





    <P><B>6.3. Derivative Works</B>. 





    <BR>If you create or use a modified version of this License (which you


    may only do in order to apply it to code which is not already Covered


    Code governed by this License), you must (a) rename Your license so that


    the phrases <font color=red>``AbiSource'', ``AbiPL'', </font>


    or any confusingly similar phrase do not appear anywhere in your license


    and (b) otherwise make it clear that your version of the license contains


    terms which differ from the <font color=red>AbiSource</font> Public 


    License. (Filling in the name of the Initial Developer, Original Code or


    Contributor in the notice described in <B>Exhibit A</B> shall not of


    themselves be deemed to be modifications of this License.)





</UL>


<B>7. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.</B>


<UL>





    COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN ``AS IS'' BASIS,


    WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING,


    WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED CODE IS FREE OF DEFECTS,


    MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE


    RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED CODE IS WITH


    YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED CODE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE


    INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY


    NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY


    CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED CODE


    IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.





</UL>


<B>8. TERMINATION.</B>


<UL>





    This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate


    automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure


    such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. All


    sublicenses to the Covered Code which are properly granted shall survive


    any termination of this License.  Provisions which, by their nature, must


    remain in effect beyond the termination of this License shall survive.





</UL>


<B>9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.</B>


<UL>





    UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING


    NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL THE INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY


    OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED CODE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF


    ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO YOU OR ANY OTHER PERSON FOR ANY


    INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER


    INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK


    STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER


    COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED


    OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL


    NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH


    PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH


    LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION


    OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THAT EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION


    MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.





</UL>


<B>10. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.</B>


<UL>





    The Covered Code is a ``commercial item,'' as that term is defined in 48


    C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of ``commercial computer software''


    and ``commercial computer software documentation,'' as such terms are


    used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212


    and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all


    U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Code with only those rights set


    forth herein.





</UL>


<B>11. MISCELLANEOUS.</B>


<UL>





    This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject matter


    hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable,


    such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it


    enforceable. This License shall be governed by <font color=red>Illinois</font> law provisions


    (except to the extent applicable law, if any, provides otherwise),


    excluding its conflict-of-law provisions. With respect to disputes in


    which at least one party is a citizen of, or an entity chartered or


    registered to do business in, the United States of America: (a) unless


    otherwise agreed in writing, all disputes relating to this License


    (excepting any dispute relating to intellectual property rights) shall be


    subject to final and binding arbitration, with the losing party paying


    all costs of arbitration; (b) any arbitration relating to this Agreement


    shall be held in <font color=red>Cook County, 


    Illinois</font>; and (c) any litigation relating to this Agreement shall


    be subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Courts of the <font color=red>Northern 


    District of Illinois, with venue lying in Chicago,


    Illinois,</font> with the losing party responsible for costs, including


    without limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys fees and


    expenses.  The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts


    for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any law or


    regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall be


    construed against the drafter shall not apply to this License.





</UL>


<B>12. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.</B>


<UL>





    Except in cases where another Contributor has failed to comply with


    Section <B>3.4</B>, You are responsible for damages arising, directly or


    indirectly, out of Your utilization of rights under this License, based


    on the number of copies of Covered Code you made available, the revenues


    you received from utilizing such rights, and other relevant factors. You


    agree to work with affected parties to distribute responsibility on an


    equitable basis.
