I used some rtl dumps and gdb to find out where the problem occurs.
It seems to be due to a definition problem what REG_EQUIV really is.

rtl.texi states:

  For @code{REG_EQUIV}, the register is equivalent to @var{op} throughout
  the entire function, and could validly be replaced in all its
  occurrences by @var{op}.  (``Validly'' here refers to the data flow of
  the program; simple replacement may make some insns invalid.)  For
  example, when a constant is loaded into a register that is never
  assigned any other value, this kind of note is used.

OTOH, update_equiv_regs () in "local-alloc.c" seems to have a different
idea what REG_EQUIV might be validly used for.

Here is the relevant section from the code:

      /* If this insn introduces a "constant" register, decrease the priority
         of that register.  Record this insn if the register is only used once
         more and the equivalence value is the same as our source.

         The latter condition is checked for two reasons:  First, it is an
         indication that it may be more efficient to actually emit the insn
         as written (if no registers are available, reload will substitute
         the equivalence).  Secondly, it avoids problems with any registers
         dying in this insn whose death notes would be missed.

         If we don't have a REG_EQUIV note, see if this insn is loading
         a register used only in one basic block from a MEM.  If so, and the
         MEM remains unchanged for the life of the register, add a REG_EQUIV
         note.  */

      note = find_reg_note (insn, REG_EQUIV, NULL_RTX);

      if (note == 0 && reg_basic_block[regno] >= 0
          && GET_CODE (SET_SRC (set)) == MEM
          && validate_equiv_mem (insn, dest, SET_SRC (set)))
        REG_NOTES (insn) = note = gen_rtx (EXPR_LIST, REG_EQUIV, SET_SRC (set),
                                           REG_NOTES (insn));

Now this causes problems when the instructions get reordered later in a way
that expands the lifetime of the register so that it overlaps with a point
in time when the MEM has a different value.

Thus, REG_EQUIV is usually used as meaning 'equal in the entire scope of the
register' while equiv_regs() uses it to denote 'equal in the entire lifetime
of the register' , which is unfortunately not quite the same.

What is the correct definition of REG_EQUIV? And should there be an
additional note type to describe the situation that is currently described
wrongly as REG_EQUIV ?

This bug seems to be due to the REG_EQUIV confusion too. At least it goes
away when the appended patch is applied.
